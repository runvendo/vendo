## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- fbf265b: One front door: `vendo_make` replaces `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit`,
  and it hands back words instead of the app.

  **Breaking.** `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit` no longer exist. In their
  place is one tool with three parameters:

  ```ts
  {
    request: string,   // the ask, in the calling agent's own words — required
    app?: string,      // an existing AppId, to change that one specifically
    context?: string,  // free-text background, for callers whose conversation we cannot see
  }
  ```

  Two tools meant every calling agent — ours, a host's own AI SDK or Mastra agent,
  an outside agent over MCP — had to decide "new or change?" before it could ask,
  and get it right. That was never their decision: the seam knows whether an app
  exists, and a caller that wants a specific one says so with `app`. `context`
  exists because an outside agent's transcript is not ours to read; on our own
  doors the runtime's transcript stays authoritative and `context` is supplemental.

  **Also breaking: the tool returns a receipt, not the document.**

  ```ts
  interface MakeReceipt {
    id: AppId;
    title: string;
    status: "ready" | "building" | "failed";
    say: string; // ONE speakable line, consumer voice
  }
  ```

  The old tools returned the entire `AppDocument` — the tree, the island sources,
  the storage declarations, the machine reference. So a model was handed UI and
  trusted not to describe it, retell it, or invent from it. A model handed a tree
  eventually talks about the tree. Screens go server → slot; the agent only ever
  gets words, and `say` is the line it can utter verbatim. `status: "building"` is
  the honest answer while work continues.

  Two things follow from the receipt, and both are improvements rather than
  compromises. The automation card is now PUBLISHED by the apps runtime through the
  existing view-stream seam instead of being reconstructed at the agent bridge out
  of the edit tool's return value — one less part read by shape (01-core §16's own
  anti-smuggling rule, which that reconstruction was the exception to). And
  `instant()` now speaks the receipt's `say` rather than a canned "Updated.",
  which fixes a real mis-speak: a rejected change comes back OK, so the canned line
  claimed success for work that did not happen.

  **Migrating.** If you call the tool by name from your own agent, rename it and
  rename `prompt` → `request` and `appId` → `app`; drop `instruction` into
  `request`. If you read fields off its result, read `id` and `title` off the
  receipt and say `say`. If you had a policy rule or an override matching
  `vendo_apps_create` / `vendo_apps_edit` / `vendo_apps_*` for the build tools,
  match `vendo_make` — it deliberately sits OUTSIDE the `vendo_apps_` prefix,
  because it is the front door rather than a member of the runtime's family. Core
  exports `isVendoAppsTool(name)` for anything that needs to recognise both.

  Everything else about the call is unchanged: risk grade `read` (actions inside
  the screen are still graded and consented individually at call time), the view
  channel, the build-failed banner, and the transcript's build card.

- 10a2b44: **BREAKING:** `workspaceBash()` is removed from `@vendoai/store`, with its
  `BashRun` and `WorkspaceBashSetup` types.

  It was written as "the canonical in-process bash setup over a workspace" and
  then never wired to anything. The only harness that runs real bash runs it
  INSIDE a box (`claudeCode()`, where the box's own shell and its own `/tmp` are
  real), and the machine-less harness (`vendo()`) hands the model AI-SDK tools,
  not a shell — so the `/tmp` alias and the refusal-to-exit-code translation
  existed for zero callers, in this repo and in the console.

  Nothing in Vendo imported it and it was never documented as public API (absent
  from the store README, from `docs/`, and from the archived store contract), so
  the realistic blast radius is nil — but it was an exported symbol, and removing
  one is a breaking change whether or not anybody held it.

### Minor Changes

- 21c8b10: One brain, one scheduler, and consent that is per trigger — everywhere outside
  `@vendoai/automations` that has to agree with it.

  A fire-time call now carries WHICH trigger fired (`TriggerRef.id`) and WHICH
  firing it belongs to (`TriggerRef.lineageId`), so the guard matches an away grant
  on (app, trigger) instead of app-wide — arming one trigger no longer authorizes
  its siblings — and keys effect receipts on the firing, so re-running a run that
  failed loudly cannot repeat the work the first attempt already completed. The
  store carries that dimension too: grant and run rows index the trigger, so an
  adapter that trusts its own refs narrows exactly as far as the engine does
  instead of handing back a sibling trigger's grant. An agentic firing runs through
  the same away runner the rest of Vendo uses, seeing only the connector dispatcher
  it was actually granted. A machine app's `vendo.json` schedules are folded into
  its document triggers when the manifest syncs, so there is exactly one scheduler
  in the deployment (the automations engine) and one tick that drives it. The panel
  and the wire follow: per-trigger enable, disable, dry-run and adopt doors, a
  `POST /runs/:runId/rerun` door, and a run that stopped for a missing permission
  showing "Failed" with the consent card and Grant & re-run right on the row.

- 14e8246: A team-shared file now reaches the `claudeCode()` sandbox — and its edits come home.

  Orgs, teams and sharing shipped, and the sandbox harness never learned. On
  `claudeCode()` a file in an `/orgs/<org>` mount was invisible: "update our team's
  Quarterly Report app" answered that it does not exist, or built a personal
  duplicate. Worse, when a path did reach the box, the edit was filtered out on the
  way back — the agent said "done" and the write was dropped with no error
  anywhere. The same ask on `vendo()` worked, because the in-process façade asked
  `can()` and the sandbox path asked a hardcoded table of two mount prefixes.

  Permission on the sandbox path is now the workspace's, per file:

  - `WorkspaceFs.canCommit(path)` (new) answers "may this caller land a write
    here?" against LIVE rows — the same question `commit()` already asked itself
    per staged path. `/host` and anything outside the caller's mounts answer false;
    inside `/orgs/<org>/apps/<appId>/**` the app's own grants decide.
  - Checkout materializes every visible file and marks it read-only per FILE, so a
    viewer-level team app lands read-only beside an editable one and the model
    meets the refusal when it reaches for the file — not after rewriting it.
  - Sync-back re-asks the same question against live rows for writes and for
    deletions, so a grant revoked mid-session bites, and one refused org path can
    never take the caller's own work down with it.
  - A team app's `plan.vendo`/`app.vendo` are watched mid-turn like a personal
    app's, so its skeleton paints during the turn instead of at the end.

  `@vendoai/apps` is in this bump because the box door it publishes
  (`box/turn-routes.mjs`, the `./box-door` export, shipped in the machine image)
  carries the other half: its whole-tree and by-shape walks used to answer about
  `/user/` only, so a team file's edit was left on the box's disk. A new
  `@vendoai/harnesses` against an old `@vendoai/apps` is this bug again — the two
  must move together.

  For hosts this is additive: `WorkspaceFs` is produced by
  `workspaceStore(store).open(...)` and consumed, never implemented — the new
  method only widens what you can call on the workspace you already hold.

- b576ab9: Transcripts and harness state ride StoreOps, so a hosted store can serve a
  harness turn.

  `threadMessageStore` and `harnessStateStore` opened with `dbFor(store)` and threw
  "Unknown VendoStore handle" for anything `@vendoai/store` did not mint — which is
  every key-only deployment. So `storeServesHarnessTurns` answered false for them
  and the host silently fell back to the legacy chat path: hosted deployments could
  not use `harness:` at all.

  - `VendoStore` gains an optional `ops?: StoreOps`. The Cloud `hostedStore` already
    exposed one, so it satisfies the member with no change.
  - One internal selector, `backendOf`, decides for every store-shaped helper: the
    SQL handle when there is one (same database, one hop shorter), the store's own
    32-op surface when there is not, and a named `not-implemented` refusal only when
    the store offers neither. Nothing above the store package can tell the two
    apart — no caller changed.
  - Transcripts ride the wire as-is: `transcripts.putMessage` for the write,
    `transcripts.getThread` for the read, ownership enforced against the thread
    record's subject exactly as the SQL join enforces it against `vendo_threads`.
    A foreign or absent thread reads as empty and refuses writes, as it does
    locally. A guarded (`expectedRevision`) edit has no wire expression and is
    refused loudly rather than downgraded to last-write-wins; no runtime caller
    asks for one.
  - Harness state rides the wire's `harness` family under the SAME slot the SQL
    half uses (`harness_state:<threadId>`, keyed by the thread's owner), so §1.3's
    rules — one slot per thread, a foreign harness destroying rather than shadowing
    it, the slot dying with its thread — hold on both backends.

  The harness-turn refusal now names both options instead of only SQL, and the
  route probe accepts an ops-capable store.

  Proven where it counts: one behavioral suite for each helper runs against three
  backends (real Postgres/PGlite, core's `memoryStoreOps`, and the local 32-op
  backend), and a live seam test writes through the real helper over a real
  `hostedStore` against the real console and reads it back on a second,
  freshly-constructed client — no stub on either side.

  Known gap, recorded as a live `it.fails` rather than a comment: the console's
  `transcripts.putMessage` appends instead of editing by id, so re-writing an
  already persisted message (the approval flip) is refused there. The fix is
  console-side; the local backends already do the right thing.

- fbf265b: A turn, a beat and a screen each say what they are — plus an app's code moves
  into its row.

  **`Turn.turnId`, and every audit row carries it.** There was no turn id anywhere,
  so an audit row, a mirrored tool call and a painted view could not be joined to
  the exchange they came out of. "Which calls belonged to the turn where the user
  asked for X" was unanswerable from the audit plane — the plane billing and
  reconciliation read. `mintTurnId()` mints `"trn_<32 hex>"`, the runtime stamps it
  where it already builds the `Turn`, and it rides the `RunContext` from that line
  on, so every guarded call, audit row and painted view downstream is joinable
  without a new parameter on fifteen signatures. Opaque to adapters. Additive for
  hosts: `RunContext.turnId` and `AuditEvent.turnId` are optional, and absent means
  "no turn", never "unknown turn".

  **Beats.** `HarnessEvent`'s `status` member gains an optional `phase`
  (`"understanding" | "planning" | "assembling" | "building" | "checking" |
"finishing"` — closed at six) and an optional `appId`. The union itself stays
  closed at four members, because adding one is a breaking change for every host
  renderer and widening one is not. A harness that yields only `label` puts the
  identical transient `data-vendo-status` chunk on the wire it always did.

  **`ScreenDescription`.** The view channel carried `UIPayload` —
  `{ formatVersion: string; [key: string]: unknown }` — an open bag whose seven real
  fields were read by inline cast at each consumer, so a deployed host frontend had
  nothing to hold us to. The fields are now declared and versioned, and the render
  seam GATES on them: what it compiles must parse or nothing paints, which is the
  law that seam already lived by for content that does not compile. The schema
  refuses `data` outright — a description says what to fetch, never what came back
  — so that law is enforceable rather than written down.

  **`AppDocument.source`.** An app's code had three homes: island TSX in
  `components`, the wire surface in workspace file rows, and — for a served app —
  only inside the sandbox snapshot behind `machine.snapshotRef`. Lose the snapshot
  and the customer's app was gone, because the store never had it. `source` maps
  POSIX-relative paths to `AppSourceFile { hash, bytes, text?, blobRef? }`, inline
  up to `WORKSPACE_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (which moves to `@vendoai/core`, where its two
  readers can both see one answer) and blob-spilled past it through the SAME
  `FilesAdapter` the workspace rows already spill to. `machine.snapshotRef` becomes
  a cache: an app can always be rebuilt from its row.

  `checkoutApp` / `commitApp` in `@vendoai/apps` make a workspace a working copy of
  that row — checkout projects the document onto a filesystem, commit diffs the
  changed paths back. The two hot paths (`app.vendo`, `plan.vendo`) stay the render
  seam's, `trigger` travels untouched through every path, and a source key that
  would escape the app's directory is refused by the document validator.

  All additive for hosts: every new field is optional, every schema stays
  `.passthrough()`, and rows written before this keep parsing unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 22601e3: Add the dedicated knowledge record collections `vendo_knowledge_docs` / `vendo_knowledge_chunks` (MCP-door table layout: id/data/refs/created_at/updated_at, GIN index on refs, newest-first keyset index) and bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` 4→5 so existing databases actually create them (the DDL loop only runs while `version < SCHEMA_VERSION` — review fix F1). Both tables join the erase-by-subject/app cascade.
- f49b1de: New `@vendoai/store/postgres` entry point: the same store (schema, records, blobs, secrets, helpers) with a `createStore` that requires a Postgres `url` and keeps `@electric-sql/pglite` out of the module graph entirely. The main entry is unchanged — PGlite stays the zero-config dev default — but serverless consumers on a real Postgres (Cloudflare Workers, Lambda, Vercel) should import from `@vendoai/store/postgres` so their bundles stop carrying megabytes of wasm Postgres they can never execute (a console Worker in the field silently crossed Cloudflare's bundle size ceiling this way). Purity is enforced by a new portability-gate leg (node-resolution esbuild metafile over `dist/postgres.js`) and a PGlite import tripwire test.

### Patch Changes

- 835d17a: Edge-runtime portability: the server entry now bundles and boots on
  Web-standard runtimes (Cloudflare Workers first). Fetch defaults are
  invocation-safe, the optional e2b SDK no longer breaks esbuild/Wrangler
  builds, Node-only legs (local store engines, dev model ladder, telemetry
  disk config, actions sync tooling) sit behind worker/edge export
  conditions with honest guidance, and createVendo performs no I/O, timers,
  or random generation at construction — module-scope wiring works. A CI
  portability gate (bundle + real workerd boot) keeps it that way.

  Note for hosts that reach into composed blocks directly: the BYO tool seam
  (`vendo.guardedTools`, and the ai-sdk/mastra packs built on it) arms schema
  readiness on first execute. Raw `vendo.store`/`vendo.automations` reach-ins
  should `await vendo.store.ensureSchema()` first — the previous eager kick
  only ever gave that pattern a racy head start.

### Minor Changes

- 49e9ccc: Add database-level atomic claims for multi-instance OAuth code redemption and refresh-token rotation.
- 0032a67: Add optional atomic record claims and revision CAS, use them to deduplicate multi-instance automation firing, and abort in-process agentic runs when stopped.
- ff6b5d5: Principals + orgs (ENG-263). Anonymous→signed-in auto-merge: the first authenticated request carrying a valid anon cookie adopts the session's threads/apps/state into the real subject and retires the cookie — idempotently, without ever overwriting an existing row; grants, approvals, and connected accounts deliberately do not migrate (consent doesn't transfer identities). Away re-verification rides actAs: the host declining to mint fails the run closed, and every actAs-authenticated call audits its disposition (`detail.actAs`). Runtime-minted subjects move into the reserved `vendo:` namespace (`vendo:webhook:<source>`); host principal resolvers producing reserved subjects (or org-kind principals) are rejected loudly. `kind:"org"` and the `vendo:org:<id>` subject shape remain reserved but inert — no org storage, management surface, or activation ships in this release.

### Patch Changes

- 023b3c0: Security hardening (ENG-251).

  - **Run-token anti-replay** (`@vendoai/apps`): run tokens now carry a random `jti`
    nonce. A run's jti is burned when its machine is torn down, so a captured token
    replayed afterwards is rejected at the proxy even though its HMAC and TTL still
    verify — shrinking the replay window from the full 15-minute TTL to the live run.
    A token remains valid for every callback of its own live run (tools, state,
    egress), so legitimate repeated proxy calls are unaffected. A token minted with
    no `jti` fails closed.
  - **Timing-safe `/tick` compare** (`@vendoai/vendo`): the `VENDO_TICK_SECRET`
    bearer check used plain string equality (a timing oracle). It now uses a
    WebCrypto HMAC-digest constant-time compare — edge-safe, no `node:crypto`.
  - **Bounded ephemeral-subject set** (`@vendoai/store`): the anonymous-visitor
    ephemeral-subject set is now a bounded LRU (10k) instead of growing until
    process restart. The subject registered for the current request is never the
    one evicted.

- dab84c2: Performance: bound the automations tick and the agent's per-turn context.

  - **automations**: the tick fetches only schedule-triggered apps through an indexed
    `trigger_kind` ref (was a full scan of every app for every subject) and batches every
    schedule cursor into one query (was an N+1 get per app). Fired automations now execute
    with bounded parallelism (`tickConcurrency`, default 4) and an optional per-run timeout
    (`runTimeoutMs`), so one hung run cannot block other tenants or overrun the tick
    interval. `emit` likewise fetches only the subject's host-event apps. `/tick` still
    returns the same runIds.
  - **agent**: Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoints on the static system prompt and the
    stable history prefix (ignored by other providers); a default tool-output cap so one
    huge host-tool response cannot blow the context (`config.agent.toolOutputCap`); a new
    `historyWindow` knob bounding what is re-sent per turn (default: the full thread, as
    before); and thread listing that derives titles from a stored `title` instead of loading
    every thread's full message array.
  - **store**: btree indexes backing the `(created_at, id)` keyset pagination on
    `vendo_records` and the paged MCP tables, a generated `trigger_kind` column on
    `vendo_apps`, and a `title` column on `vendo_threads`. All applied as additive DDL — no
    schema-version bump and no data migration.
