### Minor Changes

- 49e9ccc: Add database-level atomic claims for multi-instance OAuth code redemption and refresh-token rotation.
- 0032a67: Add optional atomic record claims and revision CAS, use them to deduplicate multi-instance automation firing, and abort in-process agentic runs when stopped.
- ff6b5d5: Principals + orgs (ENG-263). Anonymous→signed-in auto-merge: the first authenticated request carrying a valid anon cookie adopts the session's threads/apps/state into the real subject and retires the cookie — idempotently, without ever overwriting an existing row; grants, approvals, and connected accounts deliberately do not migrate (consent doesn't transfer identities). Away re-verification rides actAs: the host declining to mint fails the run closed, and every actAs-authenticated call audits its disposition (`detail.actAs`). Runtime-minted subjects move into the reserved `vendo:` namespace (`vendo:webhook:<source>`); host principal resolvers producing reserved subjects (or org-kind principals) are rejected loudly. `kind:"org"` and the `vendo:org:<id>` subject shape remain reserved but inert — no org storage, management surface, or activation ships in this release.

### Patch Changes

- 023b3c0: Security hardening (ENG-251).

  - **Run-token anti-replay** (`@vendoai/apps`): run tokens now carry a random `jti`
    nonce. A run's jti is burned when its machine is torn down, so a captured token
    replayed afterwards is rejected at the proxy even though its HMAC and TTL still
    verify — shrinking the replay window from the full 15-minute TTL to the live run.
    A token remains valid for every callback of its own live run (tools, state,
    egress), so legitimate repeated proxy calls are unaffected. A token minted with
    no `jti` fails closed.
  - **Timing-safe `/tick` compare** (`@vendoai/vendo`): the `VENDO_TICK_SECRET`
    bearer check used plain string equality (a timing oracle). It now uses a
    WebCrypto HMAC-digest constant-time compare — edge-safe, no `node:crypto`.
  - **Bounded ephemeral-subject set** (`@vendoai/store`): the anonymous-visitor
    ephemeral-subject set is now a bounded LRU (10k) instead of growing until
    process restart. The subject registered for the current request is never the
    one evicted.

- dab84c2: Performance: bound the automations tick and the agent's per-turn context.

  - **automations**: the tick fetches only schedule-triggered apps through an indexed
    `trigger_kind` ref (was a full scan of every app for every subject) and batches every
    schedule cursor into one query (was an N+1 get per app). Fired automations now execute
    with bounded parallelism (`tickConcurrency`, default 4) and an optional per-run timeout
    (`runTimeoutMs`), so one hung run cannot block other tenants or overrun the tick
    interval. `emit` likewise fetches only the subject's host-event apps. `/tick` still
    returns the same runIds.
  - **agent**: Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoints on the static system prompt and the
    stable history prefix (ignored by other providers); a default tool-output cap so one
    huge host-tool response cannot blow the context (`config.agent.toolOutputCap`); a new
    `historyWindow` knob bounding what is re-sent per turn (default: the full thread, as
    before); and thread listing that derives titles from a stored `title` instead of loading
    every thread's full message array.
  - **store**: btree indexes backing the `(created_at, id)` keyset pagination on
    `vendo_records` and the paged MCP tables, a generated `trigger_kind` column on
    `vendo_apps`, and a `title` column on `vendo_threads`. All applied as additive DDL — no
    schema-version bump and no data migration.
