### Minor Changes

- 89153f8: Delete the pre-v3 `.vendo` format layer and the semantics dev-server pass.

  `.vendo/` is now one format, not two. The `vendo/tools@1` / `vendo/overrides@1`
  schemas, `vendo/capabilities@1`, `vendo/semantics@1`, `vendoFileVersion`, and
  every dual-format reader and in-memory migration fold are gone; the surviving
  `@3` names lost their `V3` suffix (`toolsFileSchema`, `overridesFileSchema`,
  `ExtractedTool`, `OverridesFile`, `VENDO_TOOLS_FORMAT`, `VENDO_OVERRIDES_FORMAT`
  — now exported from `@vendoai/actions`, and the persisted tag strings
  `"vendo/tools@3"` / `"vendo/overrides@3"` are unchanged).

  `vendo sync` also no longer calls a running dev server to infer field
  semantics: the `POST /sync/semantics` route and its CLI pass are deleted, so a
  sync never executes host endpoints as a side effect. The per-tool `semantics`
  field itself is untouched — sync's AI enrichment proposes it and
  `overrides.json → tools[name].semantics` still wins forever.

  Removed public types: `CapabilitiesFile`, `SemanticsFile`, `OverridesFileV3`
  (use `OverridesFile`). Removed config: `createActions({ capabilities })`,
  `createVendo({ profile: { capabilities, semantics } })` — compounds and briefs
  live in `overrides.json`.

- 3ae3d13: Delete template tool descriptions and the domains manifest.

  `vendo sync` no longer invents a description for a tool your API does not
  describe. The deterministic `"Use this to …"` generator is gone: an
  undescribed tool carries `""` in `.vendo/tools.json`, which is the honest
  keyless state. Sync's AI enrichment pass proposes real descriptions when a
  model credential is present, and `overrides.json → tools[name].description`
  still wins forever.

  The domains manifest is gone end to end. Generation already receives the full
  tool list, so a derived summary of tool nouns told the model nothing new — and
  a finite `hasNot` can never enumerate what a host lacks. Removed: the `domains`
  field from both `.vendo/tools.json` and `.vendo/overrides.json`, the
  `DATA DOMAINS` prompt section, and the `domains` provider slot on the apps
  runtime.

  Removed public API: `DomainManifest` and `domainManifestSchema` (from
  `@vendoai/core`); the `domains` field on `ToolsFile` / `OverridesFile`;
  `createApps({ domains })`. `mergedSemanticsAndDomains` is now
  `mergedHostSemantics` and returns the per-tool semantics record directly
  (the `MergedHostSemantics` wrapper type is gone).

  `.vendo/overrides.json` is strict, so a leftover `domains` key now fails
  loudly at parse — delete it and re-run `vendo sync`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- cbffc9e: Freeze the knowledge contract: `KnowledgeAdapter` seam with declared capability postures, chunker/embedder interfaces (local-engine internals), the `vendo/knowledge-hash@1` doc-hash manifest schema, and a posture-adaptive conformance kit with an in-memory stub adapter.
- c7277f6: Knowledge verifier pass: where the evidence score provably cannot decide, a cheap model does.

  Calibration against the cloud engine found that answerable and unanswerable questions score in the same range, so at the best possible bar 47% of unanswerable questions still got a confident answer. `@vendoai/knowledge` now exports `entailmentVerifier`: a capped, schema-constrained check that reads the passages a search returned and decides whether they can answer the question at all. An unsupported verdict becomes the existing `insufficient-evidence` outcome, carrying the gap the verifier named so the agent can say WHAT the docs do not cover.

  **It is not score-gated.** It reads every search that returns hits. An earlier design ran it only inside a calibrated score band; the live run showed four unanswerable questions per pass scoring outside that band, never being checked, and being answered — so a check gated on the number it exists to replace inherits that number's blind spots.

  **What it is measured to do.** Live against the cloud engine over the 94-question corpus: false answers 7/34 and 10/34 on its two passes, false refusals 3/60, reading 94/94 searches at 1.37-1.39 model calls per search and adding p50 ~2.5s of verification to a verified turn (summed over that turn's calls; one call's median is ~1.7-1.8s). It reduces confident wrong answers sharply — the same corpus loses 19/34 with the check gated to a score band — but it does not eliminate them, because it cannot refuse when a verification times out and it is sometimes simply wrong. The per-question records and the full table, including the removed gated configuration, are in `docs/eval/KNOWLEDGE.md`.

  **OFF by default.** `VENDO_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFY=on` opts in for the Cloud engine; a value that is neither on nor off throws at composition rather than silently disabling a trust feature. It ships off because the measurement says it does not clear the zero-false-answer bar it exists for, while costing a model call per search and seconds on a call the user waits through — that trade is the host's to make, not a default. Only the Cloud engine composes it; BYO and self-hosted engines are untouched.

  **Enabling the check changes no threshold.** The host's `weakScoreThreshold` (default 0) is exactly what it was, and it still decides every search the check could not read. When there is a verdict the verdict decides, in both directions.

  **It fails open, and says so.** No model, a timeout, or an unusable response yields no verdict: the tool answers the way it would have without a verifier and marks the result with the additive `unverified` field on `vendo/knowledge-result@1`. The thread renders that as the amber "I couldn't check this answer against the documentation" line beside the sources, so a check that did not run is never mistaken for one that passed. Verification is capped per TURN as well as per call, so a chat→deep escalation cannot spend the cap twice.

  An empty or placeholder gap ("", "n/a", "none") fails the verdict schema, so a verdict with its evidence torn off yields no verdict at all and the tool falls open marked, rather than refusing a user with a reason that says nothing.

  The verifier rides its own `knowledgeVerifier` model slot (`VENDO_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFIER`, `models.knowledgeVerifier`) beside `judge` — pinning the model that grades answers no longer repoints the one that gates them.

  `@vendoai/knowledge` now declares `ai` as a peer dependency (with the zod floor every ai peer needs), matching `@vendoai/guard`.

- da9d4a9: Draft the knowledge wire protocol (`vendo/knowledge-wire@1`): the HTTP profile of the `KnowledgeAdapter` contract — mount-relative endpoint paths, request/response schemas, the standard error envelope with its status table, and pure error-mapping helpers — plus two new behavioral conformance cases (fetch-side visibility, real limit truncation).
- f5fbb4b: Make the MCP door presentable: per-surface tool menus, human tool titles, and
  risk-derived MCP annotations.

  Hosts curate what each surface offers from `.vendo/overrides.json`'s new
  `surfaces` block (`agent` and `mcp`, a closed key set so a misspelled surface
  fails loudly at parse). `ActionsRegistry.surfaceMenu()` resolves it: the
  authored list wins, an absent `agent` menu is unrestricted, and an absent `mcp`
  menu falls back to every merged, enabled tool whose `audience` is `end-user` or
  unset. Menus are curation, not security: the guard, `disabled`, and audience
  exclusions are untouched, an off-menu call returns the same not-found an unknown
  tool returns, and a menu entry naming a missing or disabled tool warns once and
  is skipped rather than taking the host down. Vendo's own `vendo_*` runtime tools
  are never curated away on either surface.

  `ToolDescriptor` and `ToolOverride` gain an optional `title`: the short human
  label for surfaces people read. `vendo sync`'s AI enrichment proposes one per
  tool (presentation, so it is exempt from the restrictive-only clamp and carried
  across structural syncs); `.vendo/overrides.json` corrects it. The door emits it
  in both standard MCP places (top-level `title` and `annotations.title`), and
  approval cards prefer it over the prettified tool id, behind an in-code
  `ToolMeta.label`.

  **Upgrade note.** Every tool the door lists now carries `annotations`
  unconditionally, including for hosts with no `surfaces` block. That means a
  `read` tool asserts `readOnlyHint: true` to clients, and some MCP clients use
  that hint to skip their own confirmation prompt for read calls. Nothing changes
  server-side: Vendo's guard, policy, approvals, and audit decide exactly what
  they decided before, and annotations are hints the spec says clients may
  ignore. If you have a `read`-labelled tool that is not actually side-effect
  free, correct its `risk` in `.vendo/overrides.json` — that label was already
  driving your policy.

  Every tool the door lists now also carries `annotations` derived from its risk
  label (`read` → `readOnlyHint`, `destructive` → `destructiveHint`), and the door
  serves a themed, script-free, unauthenticated connect page at `{mount}/connect`
  with the MCP URL and per-client setup steps for Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor.
  demo-bank ships a curated twelve-tool menu as the worked example.

- 221b851: Vendo Cloud meter refusals (pricing v3 §5: HTTP 402, stable code
  `meter-exhausted`, structured body) now surface honestly everywhere the OSS
  client can meet them — with no client-side entitlement checks; the refusal
  body stays the only source of truth. Core gains `parseMeterExhausted` /
  `formatMeterExhausted` / `meterExhaustedFromError`: one crafted sentence
  naming the meter, the usage figures and reset date, and the two exits
  (upgrade / BYO). The Cloud adapters (hosted store, sandbox, connections,
  apps) render that sentence on their existing 402 → cloud-required mapping
  with the structured fields preserved on `detail`; the agent recognizes the
  gateway's 402 refusal on the safe stream-error rail so the thread banner
  ends the turn with it; the CLI prints the same single line instead of a raw
  error dump, and doctor's existing live-turn check surfaces safe
  Vendo-prefixed error frames verbatim. Scheduler-refused automation runs
  already read back as failed runs — the blocked reason and code now have
  test-pinned rendering in run history.
- d1364b6: Chrome wave: split-view workspace with morphing stage, compact embeds, staged blur, stage pinning (host onPin seam), AutomationCard, ConnectCard lifecycle states, landing composer, docked new-reply banner, streaming skeletons, WorkingRibbon, connect-dock resilience, ApprovalSheet fixes, approvals-decided resume event, and eventOutcomeLabel stream-part semantics.

### Patch Changes

- 0b58e3e: Generation now rejects capability substitution: a mutating host tool invoked with a hand-typed target or amount is sent back to repair instead of shipped. The live defect this closes had a generated island calling `host_transferMoney({ amount: 1, recipient_name: 'Slack Forwarding Bot', memo: 'APPROVED TRANSACTIONS: …' })` on a host with no messaging tool — a payments API used as a message channel, with a real side effect. The rule is mechanical (argument provenance, not intent matching): operands that arrive through tool data, user input, form state, or a row the user acted on always pass; the values the user themselves named in their request always pass; enums, flags and consts a tool declares never trip it. Both surfaces are covered — declarative action payloads and `tools.*` calls in island source. When the host lacks the capability, the honest disclaimer path is the only valid answer.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 31f899e: A chat turn whose app build terminally fails now ENDS, with the classified
  failure reason visible in the thread. Before, the failed build came back as a
  plain error outcome only the model could see: the tray rendered nothing, and
  the model re-ran the minutes-long doomed build inside the same turn until the
  step cap — a thread stuck "streaming" for 10+ minutes with no banner and no
  reason (0.4.4 E2E cert). The agent's tool bridge now streams an additive
  `data-vendo-build-failed` part (toolCallId + the runtime's canned, non-leaky
  reason) beside the failed `vendo_apps_create` result, the agent loop stops the
  turn after the failed build (re-asking is the user's call, matching the BYO
  embed's failed vocabulary), and the thread renders the part as an error beat
  with the reason.

  The generation engine also names an empty model stream as its own failure
  class ("completed without any text output") instead of reporting the empty
  string's wire-parse issues — the 0.4.4 cert's "wire missing-app / empty
  layout" failures were a gateway alias ending turns reasoning-only, not a
  model-format defect, and the old issue list mis-routed that triage.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 835d17a: Edge-runtime portability: the server entry now bundles and boots on
  Web-standard runtimes (Cloudflare Workers first). Fetch defaults are
  invocation-safe, the optional e2b SDK no longer breaks esbuild/Wrangler
  builds, Node-only legs (local store engines, dev model ladder, telemetry
  disk config, actions sync tooling) sit behind worker/edge export
  conditions with honest guidance, and createVendo performs no I/O, timers,
  or random generation at construction — module-scope wiring works. A CI
  portability gate (bundle + real workerd boot) keeps it that way.

  Note for hosts that reach into composed blocks directly: the BYO tool seam
  (`vendo.guardedTools`, and the ai-sdk/mastra packs built on it) arms schema
  readiness on first execute. Raw `vendo.store`/`vendo.automations` reach-ins
  should `await vendo.store.ensureSchema()` first — the previous eager kick
  only ever gave that pattern a racy head start.

## 0.4.3

## 0.4.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- b7a860f: Release pipeline hardening: the release gate now runs the PostgreSQL store
  suite like CI does, and publishing uses npm trusted publishing (OIDC) with
  provenance — no npm tokens anywhere. This patch is the first release cut
  end-to-end by the automated pipeline.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 49e9ccc: Add database-level atomic claims for multi-instance OAuth code redemption and refresh-token rotation.
- 0032a67: Add optional atomic record claims and revision CAS, use them to deduplicate multi-instance automation firing, and abort in-process agentic runs when stopped.
- 4b8ac66: Per-user connected accounts via the Composio broker (ENG-262). Connectors gain a subject-scoped `connections` capability (list/initiate/status/disconnect); the umbrella serves per-principal `/connections` endpoints with a Vendo Cloud broker seam behind `VENDO_API_KEY`; a Composio call missing a connection returns the new typed `connect-required` tool outcome, rendered by `VendoThread` as an inline connect card that retries after connecting; `ConnectedAccountsPanel` (list + disconnect) joins the chrome as the accounts tab. Composio tools carry curated risk (metadata hints + slug patterns) instead of a blanket `write`; the MCP connector accepts an async per-principal `headers` resolver with per-subject sessions; every connector execution is audited with its account identity.
- ff6b5d5: Principals + orgs (ENG-263). Anonymous→signed-in auto-merge: the first authenticated request carrying a valid anon cookie adopts the session's threads/apps/state into the real subject and retires the cookie — idempotently, without ever overwriting an existing row; grants, approvals, and connected accounts deliberately do not migrate (consent doesn't transfer identities). Away re-verification rides actAs: the host declining to mint fails the run closed, and every actAs-authenticated call audits its disposition (`detail.actAs`). Runtime-minted subjects move into the reserved `vendo:` namespace (`vendo:webhook:<source>`); host principal resolvers producing reserved subjects (or org-kind principals) are rejected loudly. `kind:"org"` and the `vendo:org:<id>` subject shape remain reserved but inert — no org storage, management surface, or activation ships in this release.

### Patch Changes

- b6def0f: Capture capability misses from embedded agent runs in a local JSONL sink and,
  when a Cloud API key and telemetry consent are present, upload them in bounded
  best-effort batches with the canonical enabled-tool surface.
- fa0ad98: Test hardening (ENG-255): wire v8 coverage across every package with a ratcheted
  per-package line-coverage floor enforced in CI (`pnpm test:coverage`), remove
  `--passWithNoTests` so empty suites fail, add dedicated unit tests for the
  thin/zero-test hot paths (core schemas + component-map, agent prompt, store
  run/audit helpers, automations engine), and add cross-block journeys J8 (actions
  OpenAPI sync callable over the wire), J9 (Postgres durability + restart drill),
  J10 (multi-tenant concurrency isolation), and J11 (telemetry allowlist wire).
  No runtime behavior changes.
- 51f3fc9: Fix (ENG-353): heartbeat-armed idle-abort fallback for client disconnects the runtime never surfaces. Under `next dev` a real browser's graceful tab-close/navigate-away fires neither `request.signal` nor a stream cancel, so an abandoned turn ran to completion and burned provider tokens. The panel now beats `POST /threads/:id/heartbeat` while a turn streams; the first beat arms a server-side idle watchdog that aborts the turn through the same controller as the fast path after ~15s of silence. The fetch-abort fast path is unchanged, and consumers that never beat (curl/scripted clients) keep exact run-to-completion semantics.
