### Minor Changes

- 3ae3d13: Delete template tool descriptions and the domains manifest.

  `vendo sync` no longer invents a description for a tool your API does not
  describe. The deterministic `"Use this to …"` generator is gone: an
  undescribed tool carries `""` in `.vendo/tools.json`, which is the honest
  keyless state. Sync's AI enrichment pass proposes real descriptions when a
  model credential is present, and `overrides.json → tools[name].description`
  still wins forever.

  The domains manifest is gone end to end. Generation already receives the full
  tool list, so a derived summary of tool nouns told the model nothing new — and
  a finite `hasNot` can never enumerate what a host lacks. Removed: the `domains`
  field from both `.vendo/tools.json` and `.vendo/overrides.json`, the
  `DATA DOMAINS` prompt section, and the `domains` provider slot on the apps
  runtime.

  Removed public API: `DomainManifest` and `domainManifestSchema` (from
  `@vendoai/core`); the `domains` field on `ToolsFile` / `OverridesFile`;
  `createApps({ domains })`. `mergedSemanticsAndDomains` is now
  `mergedHostSemantics` and returns the per-tool semantics record directly
  (the `MergedHostSemantics` wrapper type is gone).

  `.vendo/overrides.json` is strict, so a leftover `domains` key now fails
  loudly at parse — delete it and re-run `vendo sync`.

- a7199db: Chrome polish wave + the automation card's missing emitter.

  - **Status ribbon docks onto the composer** (Codex-style): narrower than the
    composer, top corners only, its bottom edge tucked behind the card — no more
    floating pill with a gap, on both the page surface and the overlay's
    dock-anchor DOM.
  - **Approval card de-escalated**: the ceremony card keeps the neutral surface
    with a single amber accent bar instead of the full yellow wash; the
    ALL-CAPS "CRITICAL" eyebrow is gone; risk slugs render in the user's
    language ("Irreversible", "Makes changes", "Read-only") with the raw slug
    intact on `data-risk` and the tooltip.
  - **App-card dot stands down when ready**: the pulsing build dot fades and
    collapses once the view is generated; the ready bar carries just the name.
  - **`.fl-btn` is a non-wrapping flex row**: icon + label ride one line (the
    connect card's "Connecting…" spinner no longer folds onto its own line).
  - **`VendoPage` accepts `thread`** (`suggestions` + `discoverability`
    passthrough to the chat tab), so hosts can move their curated landing onto
    the full workspace; Maple's Ask Maple page and Cadence's assistant now
    render the workspace console.
  - **The automation card now actually streams**: `vendo_apps_edit` ok-outputs
    that armed an automation emit `data-vendo-automation` from the agent tool
    bridge (name-scoped, 01 §16), and the apps runtime reports the armed
    trigger's true `enabled` state on `EditResult.automation`. The playground
    gallery gains an "Automation created" scenario.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f95feb7: Runtime/generation wave: `apps.pipeline` threading through createVendo, `agent.instructions` host-voice seam, per-instance judge model binding (bindVendoModelSlots — the process-level slot registry is gone; `Judge.model` is now part of the guard's Judge contract), island-scoped repair + concurrent tier-0 paint lane with a monotonic partial gate, region-parallel assembly compiling the production inline-reference dialect, smoke-render environment failures skipping instead of failing apps, no-emoji contract rules, and per-lane generation logging (onTiming/onPipeline wired to the operator console).

### Patch Changes

- 0b58e3e: Generation now rejects capability substitution: a mutating host tool invoked with a hand-typed target or amount is sent back to repair instead of shipped. The live defect this closes had a generated island calling `host_transferMoney({ amount: 1, recipient_name: 'Slack Forwarding Bot', memo: 'APPROVED TRANSACTIONS: …' })` on a host with no messaging tool — a payments API used as a message channel, with a real side effect. The rule is mechanical (argument provenance, not intent matching): operands that arrive through tool data, user input, form state, or a row the user acted on always pass; the values the user themselves named in their request always pass; enums, flags and consts a tool declares never trip it. Both surfaces are covered — declarative action payloads and `tools.*` calls in island source. When the host lacks the capability, the honest disclaimer path is the only valid answer.
- 0e3bc0a: Generation works on the Claude 5 model line. The engine hardcoded `temperature: 0` at every model call, but Claude Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 (and Opus 4.7/4.8) removed the sampling parameters and reject the request outright with `400 — "\`temperature\` is deprecated for this model."`, so a host configuring any of those models could not generate at all. Sampling is now capability-gated on the model id: temperature is dropped only where the model rejects it and `temperature: 0`is preserved everywhere else. The same gate sets an explicit output cap on those ids, so a host whose`@ai-sdk/anthropic`predates the 5 line can no longer silently fall back to`max_tokens: 4096` and truncate a generated app mid-wire.
- f965d77: A create whose document generated cleanly no longer loses the whole turn when the store refuses to persist it. The final view part was emitted _after_ `apps.put`, so a rejected write took the settling emit with it: every streamed card froze on whatever mid-stream payload it last held (a half-painted chart, an empty-state table) with no way to tell a frozen card from a genuinely empty one, the create tool answered the agent with a bare error, and the agent apologized and rebuilt the same app twice more — three cards for one prompt, none of them saved, nothing logged on the user path. Live on the deployed Maple demo, whose Cloud store was rejecting every `vendo_apps` write.

  Now the finished view is emitted before anything that can fail, a failed persist degrades the app to view-only instead of discarding it, and the failure is named in the operator log (`app not saved (<id>): the view rendered but the store rejected it`, plus `(NOT SAVED)` on the completion line) and handed to the agent as an `unsaved` note on an `ok` result — so it states the one true thing and stops, instead of apologizing for a view the user can see. Escalation is skipped for an unsaved app, since every rung writes through the same store. Separately, a query that resolves non-ok now warns once instead of silently rendering an empty card.

- 280a142: Generation repair now repoints an array-expecting prop that landed on a `{ data: [...] }` wrapper object, instead of regenerating the whole app. Live on the Maple demo, the most obvious prompt ("Show my spending by category") never rendered: the model bound the donut's `slices` array prop to the spending tool's ROOT object, validation correctly rejected it (`expected an array, the bound field is object`), and — because a kind mismatch is not a compile _binding_ error — structured repair's closed fix space was empty, so every attempt paid a full-lane regeneration. When the bound object holds exactly ONE top-level array, repair now derives the nested path and splices it with no model call; ambiguous shapes (zero or 2+ arrays) keep today's behavior. Any host returning an envelope instead of a bare array hit this.

  `vendo sync` also records a host's DECLARED response body: an OpenAPI 2xx `application/json` schema becomes `outputSchema` on the `.vendo/tools.json` entry (refs resolved), so the envelope a host returns is part of the committed contract rather than something the model infers. Nothing is invented when the spec is silent.

## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- 9f01a92: Two fixes from the first full init→app-generated e2e on real workerd:
  the island TSX validator's esbuild import is now bundler-blind (Wrangler
  inlined the Node-only package into Worker bundles, where its \_\_filename
  crash was misread as "invalid TSX" and failed EVERY app build — the field
  report's apps-create death), and a validator that crashes at runtime now
  degrades to no validation instead of failing every island. The CLI also
  accepts `--framework custom` (the flag whitelist had missed it; only the
  programmatic path worked).
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.8

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- fd9260d: Empty-states batch — a fresh install's FIRST generated app now renders well
  with no bindable host data. Generation always emits the requested component
  bound to its tool (the Kit renders the designed empty state) instead of
  omitting it or writing prose into a tile; the no-data explanation is one
  consolidated "About this view" note, charts route to the Kit, and the app
  name is a <=40-char display title (validated on create) instead of the
  request echoed back. The Kit stat tile shows a compact em dash for empty
  values and truncates prose-length text into a tooltip, empty label/value
  pairs render an em dash, and the in-thread app panel scrolls its top into
  view when a live build settles. The create-app tool description also stops
  callers baking pre-computed figures or branding into the prompt.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.7

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 60c5e39: A create_app build can no longer die silently (0.4.5 E2E cert defect D, byo-ai-sdk host). Three layers: a build whose every region was disclaimed away ("This part of the request isn't available on this host.") now fails terminally with an honest host-capability reason instead of persisting as a "successful" app that reads as a build hanging forever; a server-side build watchdog persists a terminal failed record when a build task neither completes nor throws inside its window (VENDO_APP_BUILD_WATCHDOG_MS, default 4 min), so the embed always resolves even if the build promise hangs or is severed by the host runtime; and the embed's build deadline is now an absolute client-side timer with a per-poll timeout, so a hung open() poll can no longer freeze the building beat past the deadline.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.6

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 31f899e: A chat turn whose app build terminally fails now ENDS, with the classified
  failure reason visible in the thread. Before, the failed build came back as a
  plain error outcome only the model could see: the tray rendered nothing, and
  the model re-ran the minutes-long doomed build inside the same turn until the
  step cap — a thread stuck "streaming" for 10+ minutes with no banner and no
  reason (0.4.4 E2E cert). The agent's tool bridge now streams an additive
  `data-vendo-build-failed` part (toolCallId + the runtime's canned, non-leaky
  reason) beside the failed `vendo_apps_create` result, the agent loop stops the
  turn after the failed build (re-asking is the user's call, matching the BYO
  embed's failed vocabulary), and the thread renders the part as an error beat
  with the reason.

  The generation engine also names an empty model stream as its own failure
  class ("completed without any text output") instead of reporting the empty
  string's wire-parse issues — the 0.4.4 cert's "wire missing-app / empty
  layout" failures were a gateway alias ending turns reasoning-only, not a
  model-format defect, and the old issue list mis-routed that triage.

- 87eadba: fix(venue): e2b is only selectable when actually usable — 0.4.4 regression

  `e2bInstalled()` treated a runtime without `import.meta.resolve` as "the
  bundler inlined the SDK, so it must be available". Inside Turbopack/webpack
  server bundles that fallback always fired, so a stray `E2B_API_KEY` (for
  example inherited from the shell) flipped the venue ladder to an e2b the
  runtime could never load, outranking the Vendo Cloud sandbox and killing
  every server-app build — 0.4.3 printed `execution venue: cloud`, 0.4.4
  printed `e2b` on the same host. The probe now tests usability instead of
  importability: it asks Node's own resolver (`require.resolve` via
  `process.getBuiltinModule`, which works inside server bundles), falls back to
  a real `import.meta.resolve`, and reads an unverifiable runtime as NOT
  installed — the SDK is never bundler-inlined (the mutable-specifier import
  from the edge-portability work guarantees it), so the runtime resolver is the
  only truth. With `VENDO_API_KEY` set and no usable e2b, the venue is the
  Cloud sandbox again.

  `vendo doctor` also stops false-blessing the venue: `execution venue: e2b`
  now passes only when `E2B_API_KEY` is set and the `e2b` package resolves from
  the project; otherwise it fails with E-LIVE-007 and a concrete fix line.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 835d17a: Edge-runtime portability: the server entry now bundles and boots on
  Web-standard runtimes (Cloudflare Workers first). Fetch defaults are
  invocation-safe, the optional e2b SDK no longer breaks esbuild/Wrangler
  builds, Node-only legs (local store engines, dev model ladder, telemetry
  disk config, actions sync tooling) sit behind worker/edge export
  conditions with honest guidance, and createVendo performs no I/O, timers,
  or random generation at construction — module-scope wiring works. A CI
  portability gate (bundle + real workerd boot) keeps it that way.

  Note for hosts that reach into composed blocks directly: the BYO tool seam
  (`vendo.guardedTools`, and the ai-sdk/mastra packs built on it) arms schema
  readiness on first execute. Raw `vendo.store`/`vendo.automations` reach-ins
  should `await vendo.store.ensureSchema()` first — the previous eager kick
  only ever gave that pattern a racy head start.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- a48b1b7: Wave 2 runtime fixes from the 0.4.x E2E certification campaign:

  - Mastra shim: open-schema guarded tools (extracted routes whose body shape
    is untyped) no longer execute with `{}` when the user dictated args.
    Mastra's provider schema-compat layers hard-close every object schema for
    strict-mode providers, so an open input reached the model as "takes no
    arguments"; the shim now bridges open inputs through one declared `args`
    property (JSON object or JSON-encoded string) and unwraps it before the
    guard, so approvals park — and replay — with the real arguments.
  - Failed app builds now carry their reason everywhere: `create()` re-throws
    with the classified reason in the message (the tool outcome the calling
    agent reads), logs the un-canned issue list to the operator terminal
    (previously a silent failure), and the app embed shows a retry hint for
    retryable failures. The generation engine now captures streamText's
    swallowed provider errors, so quota/timeout/no-key failures classify
    correctly instead of collapsing to "generation failed".
  - The dev model's no-usable-credential lines (missing provider package, no
    key at all) surface verbatim in the failed-build reason — the in-surface
    error now carries the actionable `npm install @ai-sdk/...` / `vendo login`
    instruction instead of `model could not produce a valid app`.
  - `@vendoai/ui` DonutChart no longer crashes on `undefined`/non-array data
    inside generated apps; it renders the designed empty state like the other
    Kit charts.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e94fa6: Secrets egress fetch shim (ENG-290 M4, 06-apps §4.3/§4.5 option B).

  - **In-sandbox fetch shim**: every machine now carries a runtime-owned
    `/app/.vendo/fetch-shim.cjs`, loaded at boot via `NODE_OPTIONS --require` by
    the rung-2/3 boot convention, the rung-4 served-app scaffold's `start.sh`,
    and Modal's create command. Outbound `fetch(externalUrl)` from app code is
    rewritten into `POST {VENDO_PROXY_URL}/egress` authenticated by the run
    token, so plain `fetch` with a declared secret handle in a header or body
    authenticates to allowlisted hosts — substitution stays exclusively at the
    proxy, outside the sandbox. Internal requests (relative URLs, the proxy
    itself, loopback) are never rewritten; a refused egress surfaces as an
    ordinary fetch `TypeError`, never a leak.
  - **Interchange**: `.vendoapp` exports exclude the runtime-owned shim, and
    imports rebuild machines with the current shim (an archive can never smuggle
    a modified one in).
  - Env-gated live lanes prove the shim on real E2B (Modal lane parked on
    missing `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`/`MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`, exactly like the ladder
    lanes).

- 7826a6e: feat(apps): guarded per-secret in-sandbox exposure toggle (ENG-345)

  Adds the off-by-default exception path to the Option B secrets gateway: an
  owner-only, per-secret × per-app toggle that injects a secret's real value into
  the sandbox env instead of a handle. Flipping it on is a high-risk action gated
  by the guard's existing approval flow; every run with an exposed secret emits an
  audit event; and the grant lives outside the app document so it never travels
  with a share, remix, fork, export, or import (copies always revert to handles).

- 8d5423d: Generation speed: add an opt-in `onTiming` seam around `modelEngine.create` (per-lane first-paint / complete timing + token usage) and a best-effort `runtime.prewarm()` page-open model warm-up. Additive — no change to create/paint/render behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 023b3c0: Security hardening (ENG-251).

  - **Run-token anti-replay** (`@vendoai/apps`): run tokens now carry a random `jti`
    nonce. A run's jti is burned when its machine is torn down, so a captured token
    replayed afterwards is rejected at the proxy even though its HMAC and TTL still
    verify — shrinking the replay window from the full 15-minute TTL to the live run.
    A token remains valid for every callback of its own live run (tools, state,
    egress), so legitimate repeated proxy calls are unaffected. A token minted with
    no `jti` fails closed.
  - **Timing-safe `/tick` compare** (`@vendoai/vendo`): the `VENDO_TICK_SECRET`
    bearer check used plain string equality (a timing oracle). It now uses a
    WebCrypto HMAC-digest constant-time compare — edge-safe, no `node:crypto`.
  - **Bounded ephemeral-subject set** (`@vendoai/store`): the anonymous-visitor
    ephemeral-subject set is now a bounded LRU (10k) instead of growing until
    process restart. The subject registered for the current request is never the
    one evicted.

- 7546de1: Inject the standard run environment when `importApp` provisions a machine (ENG-347, 06-apps §4.2).

  Import rebuilt an app-directory machine with `env: { PORT }` only, bypassing the
  shared env helper the create/edit path uses. The secrets egress fetch shim then
  declined to install (it requires `VENDO_PROXY_URL` + `VENDO_RUN_TOKEN`), so an
  imported rung-2/3 app could not reach host tools or the egress endpoint until it
  was re-edited. Provisioning now routes through the machine cache, baking the same
  §4.2 run environment (`PORT`, `VENDO_PROXY_URL`, a freshly minted `VENDO_RUN_TOKEN`,
  and declared secret handles) into the rebuilt snapshot, so an imported app reaches
  tools/egress with no subsequent edit.

- dab84c2: Performance: bound the automations tick and the agent's per-turn context.

  - **automations**: the tick fetches only schedule-triggered apps through an indexed
    `trigger_kind` ref (was a full scan of every app for every subject) and batches every
    schedule cursor into one query (was an N+1 get per app). Fired automations now execute
    with bounded parallelism (`tickConcurrency`, default 4) and an optional per-run timeout
    (`runTimeoutMs`), so one hung run cannot block other tenants or overrun the tick
    interval. `emit` likewise fetches only the subject's host-event apps. `/tick` still
    returns the same runIds.
  - **agent**: Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoints on the static system prompt and the
    stable history prefix (ignored by other providers); a default tool-output cap so one
    huge host-tool response cannot blow the context (`config.agent.toolOutputCap`); a new
    `historyWindow` knob bounding what is re-sent per turn (default: the full thread, as
    before); and thread listing that derives titles from a stored `title` instead of loading
    every thread's full message array.
  - **store**: btree indexes backing the `(created_at, id)` keyset pagination on
    `vendo_records` and the paged MCP tables, a generated `trigger_kind` column on
    `vendo_apps`, and a `title` column on `vendo_threads`. All applied as additive DDL — no
    schema-version bump and no data migration.
