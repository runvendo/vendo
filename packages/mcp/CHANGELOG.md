# @vendoai/mcp

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 10a2b44: `agent()` mounts the tool door its harness has always required.

  `claudeCode()` declares `requires: { toolDoor: true }` on both legs — a box and
  a local subprocess each reach the host's tools over remote MCP — and
  `@vendoai/agents` never filled the slot. A boxed agent therefore booted with the
  model's own hands (Bash, Read, Write) and NONE of the host's tools: no `api()`,
  no `tool({ … })`, no `mcp:` servers. It was silent, because the harness's warning
  is itself gated on a door existing.

  `agent()` gains one optional key, **`door: { baseUrl }`** — the publicly
  reachable origin the thinker dials back to. Unset it falls back to
  `VENDO_BASE_URL`; an explicit value always wins. A `machine: "local"` thinker
  that resolves neither gets a loopback listener this package serves itself — a
  subprocess can always dial 127.0.0.1, so zero-config development loses
  nothing. A SANDBOXED harness that resolves neither is a BOOT error naming both
  ways out, never a turn that dies in front of a user: loopback is not reachable
  from a box.

  A library cannot add a route to the host's server, so the door's fetch handler
  comes back out: mount `agent.door` at the exported `DOOR_PATH`
  (`/api/vendo/mcp`, the same mount `createVendo` uses). It is
  `createMcpDoor({ internal: true })` — no authorization server, no discovery, no
  consent page, and no listing for anyone but a live turn. The door's hostname
  joins the box's egress allowlist, and the runtime's `liveTurn` seam is wired, so
  a credential the harness mints resolves to the turn that minted it and to
  nothing between turns.

  `@vendoai/agents` now depends on `@vendoai/mcp`, which widens a standalone
  install with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `jose`.

  `createTurnCredentials` — the turn-credential registry — moves from
  `@vendoai/vendo` down into `@vendoai/mcp`, beside the `LiveTurn` /
  `TurnCredentialPort` types it speaks, so the umbrella and the standalone runtime
  share ONE implementation instead of each growing their own. No behaviour change
  for `createVendo`.

- 8d623ec: Connector discovery uses the broker's own search; execution stays ours.

  `search_connectors` searched a local keyword index and then EXPANDED a matching
  toolkit server-side, expecting the client to re-list via
  `notifications/tools/list_changed`. Measured live, Claude Code's agent SDK
  registers no list-changed handler for an HTTP MCP server — exactly one
  `tools/list` per session — so a tool the model had just found was uncallable for
  the rest of that session. The shape is one the industry has abandoned (GitHub
  removed `--dynamic-toolsets`; Composio, whose catalog this is, never shipped it).

  Three permanent tools replace it, so the listing never changes and callability
  never depends on a re-list. They are ordinary registry tools, so they work on
  both the `vendo()` and `claudeCode()` harness paths:

  - **`find_service_tools(need)`** — the connector's OWN search. Each match
    carries the callable slug, the full input schema, the caller's connection
    status and the broker's next-step message, inline, so the model can construct
    a call with no second lookup. A match the broker has no schema for says so
    rather than inviting a guess. The answer is bounded by its own SERIALIZED
    size, under the turn's `agent.toolOutputCap`, so it can never be the result
    that cap truncates: broker schemas are kilobytes each (Composio's run 5–7KB),
    and a result cut at a character count loses a schema mid-object with nothing
    saying which match lost it. Matches are included whole, in the broker's
    relevance order, until the budget is spent; whatever is left over is reported
    as `moreMatches` (a count) and `moreMatchesNote` (narrow the `need` and search
    again), never dropped silently. A single schema larger than the whole budget
    still returns its row, with the same `schemaUnavailable` marker that already
    sends the model to ask rather than guess.
  - **`use_service_tool(slug, arguments)`** — looks up the broker's per-tool risk
    tag, maps it to a `RiskLabel`, lets the guard decide run/ask/refuse, executes,
    and lands on the audit trail with its toolkit named — the same guarded path a
    `host_*` call travels. An untagged tool is `ungraded` (ask-by-default); risk is
    never inferred from a tool's name.
  - **`list_connections`** — unchanged, re-backed by the connector's connection API.

  The Composio adapter also trims the documentation Composio ships for PEOPLE
  inside the machine schema — `examples`, `human_parameter_name`,
  `human_parameter_description` — before a schema reaches the model. It is a third
  of the bytes and none of it is needed to construct a call (measured against
  their live catalog 2026-08-03: eight email matches, 36,407 chars whole, 24,736
  trimmed), so trimming is what lets a realistic search come back complete instead
  of short. Only KEYWORDS are removed: a parameter named `examples` is an
  argument, and survives.

  Both new tools exist only when a connector adapter can actually serve them
  ("no adapter, no tool"): `find_service_tools` and `use_service_tool` need a
  connector implementing the new capabilities, `list_connections` needs only a
  configured connector.

  **The Composio adapter's tool plane now speaks one API version, so a tool the
  search finds is a tool that runs.** Discovery is Composio's tool-router, which
  exists only at `v3.1`; execution and the `apps`-scoped listing were still on
  `v3`. Those are two different catalogs, not two doors onto one — so the model
  would find a slug and the executor would answer `Tool <SLUG> not found`, an
  opaque connector error rather than a connect card or a hint to search again.
  Live-measured against their catalog 2026-08-03, 19 of the 42 slugs a `v3.1`
  search returned for eight ordinary needs did not exist on `v3` at all: every
  Outlook mail and calendar action (`OUTLOOK_SEND_EMAIL`, `OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT`,
  `OUTLOOK_SEND_DRAFT`, `OUTLOOK_CALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT`), every `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_*`,
  five `TEXT_TO_PDF_*`, `GOOGLECALENDAR_EVENTS_GET` and
  `WEATHERMAP_GEOCODE_LOCATION`. It only stayed hidden because Gmail and Slack
  happen to exist in both. Connector tools that used to fail now run.

  The skew ran the other way too, so the listing moved with the executor: `v3`
  carries legacy names `v3.1` has renamed (`OUTLOOK_OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT`,
  `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_NEWS_SEARCH`), and a `v3` listing feeding a `v3.1` executor
  breaks identically. An `apps`-scoped host therefore sees the larger, current
  `v3.1` catalog — Gmail goes from 23 tools to 63, Outlook from 43 to 305 — and
  more of those tools arrive `ungraded`, which is ask-by-default.

  Connected accounts and auth configs stay on `v3` deliberately: live-verified
  identical on both versions, and that plane has no catalog to skew against.
  Both versions are named in one constant each at the top of the adapter.

  **Removed public surface.** All of it existed to serve lazy expansion:

  - `@vendoai/core`: `ToolListingContext.listingScope` and
    `ToolRegistry.releaseListingScope`. A listing no longer has to be identified —
    every tool a run may call is on every listing that run is given.
  - `@vendoai/actions`: `Connector.discoveryIndex`, `Connector.expandToolkits`,
    the `ToolkitIndexEntry` type, `ActionsRegistry.expandToolkits`, the `ctx`
    parameter of `ActionsRegistry.search`/`loadoutSeed`, and
    `ToolSearchOptions.maxExpansions`. `ActionsRegistry.loadoutSeed` now answers
    with every loaded tool and ignores its `connectedToolkits` argument: the
    argument only ever filtered lazily expanded connector tools, and there are
    none. New in their place, all optional:
    `Connector.searchTools`, `Connector.toolRisk`, `Connector.executeSlug`, and the
    `ServiceToolMatch` type. `Connector.toolkitOf` is unchanged — the pre-guard
    connect check still rides it.
  - `@vendoai/agent`: `CONNECTOR_DISCOVERY_TOOLS` now names the three tools above;
    the discovery registry's ports changed shape with them.
  - `@vendoai/mcp`: the door no longer advertises `tools.listChanged`, no longer
    diffs its listing around a call, and no longer keeps a per-session
    notification-replay flag.
  - `@vendoai/vendo`: the `maxSearchExpansions` handler option.

  **Known gap, deliberately not papered over.** A connector that cannot search
  gets neither new tool, and the zero-key Vendo Cloud connector has no search
  backend today — so a Cloud-default deployment that does not scope
  `connectorApps` reaches connectors through the connect dock only until the
  console broker exposes a search endpoint. Filling that with keyword scoring or
  name-based risk inference is exactly what this change removes.

  **Automations can run connector tools, through the consent they already use.**
  `use_service_tool` is one tool name standing in for the broker's whole catalog,
  so its descriptor cannot carry a real grade — it is `ungraded`, and design §12
  withholds `ungraded` from an unattended run the same way it withholds
  `destructive`. Left there, arming an automation on a connector would have been a
  narrowing: before this wave an individually-graded `read` connector tool WAS
  offered to an automation.

  The fix reuses declare-then-accrete consent rather than inventing a mechanism.
  An automation's steps declare the service actions they will call; the person
  arming it approves those specific actions, in the enable card they already see;
  the unattended run may then call exactly those slugs.

  - **`@vendoai/core`**: `GrantScope` gains a third member,
    `{ kind: "service-tool", slug }` — the missing middle between "this whole
    tool" (twenty thousand actions on this one name) and "this exact payload"
    (useless on the next run). Plus `USE_SERVICE_TOOL`, `serviceToolSlug`,
    `serviceToolPhrase`, `withResolvedRisk`, and `RiskResolver` (moved here from
    `@vendoai/guard`, which re-exports it unchanged).
  - **`@vendoai/guard`**: a `service-tool` grant matches a call by its slug.
    `tool` and `exact` grants are untouched, and nothing attended mints the new
    scope, so chat behaviour is unchanged.
  - **`@vendoai/automations`**: `AutomationsConfig.resolveRisk` — the SAME
    resolver the composition gives the guard. Arm-time capture grades a declared
    connector call with it, so the consent card states the grade the call will
    really run under and the grant it mints carries the descriptor hash the guard
    recomputes at fire time. Capture is per service action, and its consent
    sentence names the action in a person's words ("Allow "Morning digest" to
    fetch emails in Gmail while you're away").
  - **`@vendoai/ui`**: a consent row for a connector permission reads as its
    service action with the service's own logo, instead of "Use an outside
    service" once per row.

  What did NOT change: §12 still withholds the dispatcher from every unattended
  listing, and a granted service action the broker grades `destructive` is still
  refused away — the same answer a granted `host_*` send has always got.

  **Second known limit.** An agentic automation declares no slug, so it captures
  no connector grant at arm time: its connector calls park at fire time and
  accrete a per-slug grant when a person approves them. The alternative would have
  been a tool-wide grant on the dispatcher, which is the whole catalog behind one
  card.

### Patch Changes

- dcc08ab: The MCP door no longer tells a client a tool is non-destructive when nobody has
  graded it.

  Every listing carried `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint` derived from the
  tool's risk label, and `ungraded` fell through to the same pair a `write` gets:
  `readOnlyHint: false`, `destructiveHint: false`. MCP's own default for
  `destructiveHint` is **`true`** — absent means "assume destructive" — so
  emitting `false` was not a neutral value, it was an active claim of safety about
  a tool no human, no judge, and no protocol fact had ever judged. That is exactly
  the guess the risk-grading redesign deleted everywhere else, still being made on
  the wire.

  An `ungraded` tool now asserts neither hint. They are omitted, and the client
  falls back to the spec's own conservative defaults. `destructiveHint: true`
  would have been the opposite guess and just as unfounded; `readOnlyHint: false`
  claims "this modifies its environment", which is equally unknown. The door says
  nothing it cannot support, and `title` still rides along. Grade the tool
  (`vendo sync`, the judge, or `.vendo/overrides.json`) and the hints come back.

  `read`, `write`, and `destructive` listings are byte-for-byte unchanged. Both
  surfaces that build MCP tools — the OAuth listing an outside agent sees and the
  live-turn listing a `claudeCode()` box reads — share the one helper, so they
  cannot drift.

### Minor Changes

- f5fbb4b: Make the MCP door presentable: per-surface tool menus, human tool titles, and
  risk-derived MCP annotations.

  Hosts curate what each surface offers from `.vendo/overrides.json`'s new
  `surfaces` block (`agent` and `mcp`, a closed key set so a misspelled surface
  fails loudly at parse). `ActionsRegistry.surfaceMenu()` resolves it: the
  authored list wins, an absent `agent` menu is unrestricted, and an absent `mcp`
  menu falls back to every merged, enabled tool whose `audience` is `end-user` or
  unset. Menus are curation, not security: the guard, `disabled`, and audience
  exclusions are untouched, an off-menu call returns the same not-found an unknown
  tool returns, and a menu entry naming a missing or disabled tool warns once and
  is skipped rather than taking the host down. Vendo's own `vendo_*` runtime tools
  are never curated away on either surface.

  `ToolDescriptor` and `ToolOverride` gain an optional `title`: the short human
  label for surfaces people read. `vendo sync`'s AI enrichment proposes one per
  tool (presentation, so it is exempt from the restrictive-only clamp and carried
  across structural syncs); `.vendo/overrides.json` corrects it. The door emits it
  in both standard MCP places (top-level `title` and `annotations.title`), and
  approval cards prefer it over the prettified tool id, behind an in-code
  `ToolMeta.label`.

  **Upgrade note.** Every tool the door lists now carries `annotations`
  unconditionally, including for hosts with no `surfaces` block. That means a
  `read` tool asserts `readOnlyHint: true` to clients, and some MCP clients use
  that hint to skip their own confirmation prompt for read calls. Nothing changes
  server-side: Vendo's guard, policy, approvals, and audit decide exactly what
  they decided before, and annotations are hints the spec says clients may
  ignore. If you have a `read`-labelled tool that is not actually side-effect
  free, correct its `risk` in `.vendo/overrides.json` — that label was already
  driving your policy.

  Every tool the door lists now also carries `annotations` derived from its risk
  label (`read` → `readOnlyHint`, `destructive` → `destructiveHint`), and the door
  serves a themed, script-free, unauthenticated connect page at `{mount}/connect`
  with the MCP URL and per-client setup steps for Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor.
  demo-bank ships a curated twelve-tool menu as the worked example.

### Patch Changes

- 4b8ac66: Per-user connected accounts via the Composio broker (ENG-262). Connectors gain a subject-scoped `connections` capability (list/initiate/status/disconnect); the umbrella serves per-principal `/connections` endpoints with a Vendo Cloud broker seam behind `VENDO_API_KEY`; a Composio call missing a connection returns the new typed `connect-required` tool outcome, rendered by `VendoThread` as an inline connect card that retries after connecting; `ConnectedAccountsPanel` (list + disconnect) joins the chrome as the accounts tab. Composio tools carry curated risk (metadata hints + slug patterns) instead of a blanket `write`; the MCP connector accepts an async per-principal `headers` resolver with per-subject sessions; every connector execution is audited with its account identity.
