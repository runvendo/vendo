### Minor Changes

- f5fbb4b: Make the MCP door presentable: per-surface tool menus, human tool titles, and
  risk-derived MCP annotations.

  Hosts curate what each surface offers from `.vendo/overrides.json`'s new
  `surfaces` block (`agent` and `mcp`, a closed key set so a misspelled surface
  fails loudly at parse). `ActionsRegistry.surfaceMenu()` resolves it: the
  authored list wins, an absent `agent` menu is unrestricted, and an absent `mcp`
  menu falls back to every merged, enabled tool whose `audience` is `end-user` or
  unset. Menus are curation, not security: the guard, `disabled`, and audience
  exclusions are untouched, an off-menu call returns the same not-found an unknown
  tool returns, and a menu entry naming a missing or disabled tool warns once and
  is skipped rather than taking the host down. Vendo's own `vendo_*` runtime tools
  are never curated away on either surface.

  `ToolDescriptor` and `ToolOverride` gain an optional `title`: the short human
  label for surfaces people read. `vendo sync`'s AI enrichment proposes one per
  tool (presentation, so it is exempt from the restrictive-only clamp and carried
  across structural syncs); `.vendo/overrides.json` corrects it. The door emits it
  in both standard MCP places (top-level `title` and `annotations.title`), and
  approval cards prefer it over the prettified tool id, behind an in-code
  `ToolMeta.label`.

  **Upgrade note.** Every tool the door lists now carries `annotations`
  unconditionally, including for hosts with no `surfaces` block. That means a
  `read` tool asserts `readOnlyHint: true` to clients, and some MCP clients use
  that hint to skip their own confirmation prompt for read calls. Nothing changes
  server-side: Vendo's guard, policy, approvals, and audit decide exactly what
  they decided before, and annotations are hints the spec says clients may
  ignore. If you have a `read`-labelled tool that is not actually side-effect
  free, correct its `risk` in `.vendo/overrides.json` — that label was already
  driving your policy.

  Every tool the door lists now also carries `annotations` derived from its risk
  label (`read` → `readOnlyHint`, `destructive` → `destructiveHint`), and the door
  serves a themed, script-free, unauthenticated connect page at `{mount}/connect`
  with the MCP URL and per-client setup steps for Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor.
  demo-bank ships a curated twelve-tool menu as the worked example.

- 280a142: Generation repair now repoints an array-expecting prop that landed on a `{ data: [...] }` wrapper object, instead of regenerating the whole app. Live on the Maple demo, the most obvious prompt ("Show my spending by category") never rendered: the model bound the donut's `slices` array prop to the spending tool's ROOT object, validation correctly rejected it (`expected an array, the bound field is object`), and — because a kind mismatch is not a compile _binding_ error — structured repair's closed fix space was empty, so every attempt paid a full-lane regeneration. When the bound object holds exactly ONE top-level array, repair now derives the nested path and splices it with no model call; ambiguous shapes (zero or 2+ arrays) keep today's behavior. Any host returning an envelope instead of a bare array hit this.

  `vendo sync` also records a host's DECLARED response body: an OpenAPI 2xx `application/json` schema becomes `outputSchema` on the `.vendo/tools.json` entry (refs resolved), so the envelope a host returns is part of the committed contract rather than something the model infers. Nothing is invented when the spec is silent.

### Patch Changes

- 52c72c2: Doctor judges unknown-framework hosts (Cloudflare Workers, Bun, Hono, ...)
  by their actual wiring instead of Next.js file layout — no more permanent
  E-WIRE-003/004 false positives on custom runtimes (new codes E-WIRE-007/008).
  The tool surface is now graded statically: all extracted tools disabled or
  excluded fails doctor (E-TOOLS-001), an empty surface warns (E-TOOLS-002),
  and the actions registry warns at runtime when the agent composes with zero
  live host tools — the silently-useless-agent failure mode is no longer
  silent anywhere.
- 835d17a: Edge-runtime portability: the server entry now bundles and boots on
  Web-standard runtimes (Cloudflare Workers first). Fetch defaults are
  invocation-safe, the optional e2b SDK no longer breaks esbuild/Wrangler
  builds, Node-only legs (local store engines, dev model ladder, telemetry
  disk config, actions sync tooling) sit behind worker/edge export
  conditions with honest guidance, and createVendo performs no I/O, timers,
  or random generation at construction — module-scope wiring works. A CI
  portability gate (bundle + real workerd boot) keeps it that way.

  Note for hosts that reach into composed blocks directly: the BYO tool seam
  (`vendo.guardedTools`, and the ai-sdk/mastra packs built on it) arms schema
  readiness on first execute. Raw `vendo.store`/`vendo.automations` reach-ins
  should `await vendo.store.ensureSchema()` first — the previous eager kick
  only ever gave that pattern a racy head start.

- 70b59db: Extraction now grades every tool's audience (end-user / operator / internal)
  by reading the handler's own auth checks, and excludes non-end-user tools
  from the embedded agent by default (recorded as `audience` in
  .vendo/overrides.json; human decisions always win). Applying a surface that
  leaves the agent with zero live tools warns loudly instead of shipping a
  silently useless agent. Field origin: an infra product's extraction proposed
  operator/reconciliation endpoints; stripping them by hand left an empty
  toolkit and an agent that couldn't act.

### Minor Changes

- 5d89564: Extract registered host-component catalogs deterministically during sync, persist strict catalog artifacts and stale-safe review-only copy proposals, and load generated catalogs into the umbrella runtime with actionable malformed-file warnings. TypeScript is loaded only on the sync scan path and is no longer a production dependency of `@vendoai/actions`.
- 4b8ac66: Per-user connected accounts via the Composio broker (ENG-262). Connectors gain a subject-scoped `connections` capability (list/initiate/status/disconnect); the umbrella serves per-principal `/connections` endpoints with a Vendo Cloud broker seam behind `VENDO_API_KEY`; a Composio call missing a connection returns the new typed `connect-required` tool outcome, rendered by `VendoThread` as an inline connect card that retries after connecting; `ConnectedAccountsPanel` (list + disconnect) joins the chrome as the accounts tab. Composio tools carry curated risk (metadata hints + slug patterns) instead of a blanket `write`; the MCP connector accepts an async per-principal `headers` resolver with per-subject sessions; every connector execution is audited with its account identity.
- c42d41a: Static GraphQL extractor behind the extractor seam plus an additive `graphql` binding kind in `vendo/tools@1` (ENG-247). Schemas are read statically from SDL files (parsed with the host's own graphql package) and from code-first `@nestjs/graphql` / `type-graphql` resolvers (TypeScript compiler API) — no host code runs. One tool per query and mutation, deterministic `inputSchema` from GraphQL argument types, and depth-limited default selection sets baked into executable documents. Execution POSTs `{ query, variables }` to the host endpoint with auth semantics identical to route bindings; a 200-with-`errors` response surfaces as an http-error outcome. Fail-closed rules: queries earn `read` only with read-shaped names, mutations default `write`, the destructive word list applies unchanged, and subscriptions, statically-unresolvable types, and multi-endpoint hosts are emitted `disabled: true` with a note. Route-scan tools under a GraphQL endpoint are shadowed like tRPC mounts.
- 2f67c65: Server-actions extractor behind the extractor seam (ENG-248): statically scan `"use server"` modules and inline functions with the TypeScript compiler API, interpret zod-validated and annotated inputs into JSON Schema (fail-closed to permissive + note otherwise), and emit the additive `server-action` binding kind (`module` + `exportName` + ordered `params`) within `vendo/tools@1`. Execution is direct in-process registration: `vendo init` now generates a `vendo-actions.ts` registration map wired into `createVendo({ serverActions })`; a server-action tool whose registration is missing fails closed with a clear error and no work performed. Risk labels fail closed — actions default `write`, the destructive word list applies, and unclassifiable or inline (non-importable) actions are emitted `disabled: true` with a note.
- ebc72e4: Runtime tool search and loadout (ENG-252). Add a deterministic `ActionsRegistry.search` query API (plus the pure `searchToolDescriptors`) that ranks the merged, enabled tool surface by intent, excluding disabled tools. The agent gains a `vendo_tools_search` meta-tool: it starts from a bounded initial loadout — the whole enabled surface when it fits the cap, an explicit curated list when provided, otherwise a read-first bounded default (`DEFAULT_MAX_INITIAL_TOOLS`) — and discovers and loads the rest mid-run. Loaded tools persist across turns within a thread and execute through the same guard-bound registry as any initially-enabled tool, so there is no unguarded path. The umbrella wires the search seam to the guard-bound registry.
- ff6b5d5: Principals + orgs (ENG-263). Anonymous→signed-in auto-merge: the first authenticated request carrying a valid anon cookie adopts the session's threads/apps/state into the real subject and retires the cookie — idempotently, without ever overwriting an existing row; grants, approvals, and connected accounts deliberately do not migrate (consent doesn't transfer identities). Away re-verification rides actAs: the host declining to mint fails the run closed, and every actAs-authenticated call audits its disposition (`detail.actAs`). Runtime-minted subjects move into the reserved `vendo:` namespace (`vendo:webhook:<source>`); host principal resolvers producing reserved subjects (or org-kind principals) are rejected loudly. `kind:"org"` and the `vendo:org:<id>` subject shape remain reserved but inert — no org storage, management surface, or activation ships in this release.
