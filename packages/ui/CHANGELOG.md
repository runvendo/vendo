# @vendoai/ui

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6eb8a04: **BREAKING:** the knowledge entailment verifier is removed. The knowledge
  stack is a pure retrieval plug-in again, and `weakScoreThreshold` is once more
  the sole refusal calibration — unchanged, and still the knob to tune.

  The check shipped off by default and the live measurement is why it never got
  turned on: over the 94-question corpus it still answered 7-10 of 34
  unanswerable questions per pass, while costing a model call per search and
  seconds of latency on a call the user waits through. It never cleared the bar
  it existed for, so it is gone rather than left as a knob nobody should set.

  Removed surface:

  - `@vendoai/knowledge`: `entailmentVerifier`, `KNOWLEDGE_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS`,
    `KNOWLEDGE_VERIFY_TURN_BUDGET_MS`, the `KnowledgeVerifier` /
    `KnowledgeVerdict` / `KnowledgeVerifierInput` / `KnowledgeVerifierPassage` /
    `KnowledgeVerifyOptions` / `EntailmentVerifierOptions` types, and the
    `verifier` + `verifyTurnBudgetMs` options on `createKnowledgeTools`. The tool
    reverts to its pre-verifier decision rule: chat search → one deep retry on
    weak evidence → structured `insufficient-evidence`.
  - `@vendoai/core`: the `verifier` model seat (`Seat`, `SEATS`,
    `ResolvedModels`, `migrateModelSeats`) and the `unverified` field on the
    `data-vendo-citations` stream part.
  - `@vendoai/vendo`: the `VENDO_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFY` and
    `VENDO_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFIER` environment knobs, and the
    `models.verifier` / `models.knowledgeVerifier` slots.
  - `@vendoai/ui`: the amber "I couldn't check this answer against the
    documentation" line. The engine-outage flag and the structured
    searched-line are untouched.

- fbf265b: One front door: `vendo_make` replaces `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit`,
  and it hands back words instead of the app.

  **Breaking.** `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit` no longer exist. In their
  place is one tool with three parameters:

  ```ts
  {
    request: string,   // the ask, in the calling agent's own words — required
    app?: string,      // an existing AppId, to change that one specifically
    context?: string,  // free-text background, for callers whose conversation we cannot see
  }
  ```

  Two tools meant every calling agent — ours, a host's own AI SDK or Mastra agent,
  an outside agent over MCP — had to decide "new or change?" before it could ask,
  and get it right. That was never their decision: the seam knows whether an app
  exists, and a caller that wants a specific one says so with `app`. `context`
  exists because an outside agent's transcript is not ours to read; on our own
  doors the runtime's transcript stays authoritative and `context` is supplemental.

  **Also breaking: the tool returns a receipt, not the document.**

  ```ts
  interface MakeReceipt {
    id: AppId;
    title: string;
    status: "ready" | "building" | "failed";
    say: string; // ONE speakable line, consumer voice
  }
  ```

  The old tools returned the entire `AppDocument` — the tree, the island sources,
  the storage declarations, the machine reference. So a model was handed UI and
  trusted not to describe it, retell it, or invent from it. A model handed a tree
  eventually talks about the tree. Screens go server → slot; the agent only ever
  gets words, and `say` is the line it can utter verbatim. `status: "building"` is
  the honest answer while work continues.

  Two things follow from the receipt, and both are improvements rather than
  compromises. The automation card is now PUBLISHED by the apps runtime through the
  existing view-stream seam instead of being reconstructed at the agent bridge out
  of the edit tool's return value — one less part read by shape (01-core §16's own
  anti-smuggling rule, which that reconstruction was the exception to). And
  `instant()` now speaks the receipt's `say` rather than a canned "Updated.",
  which fixes a real mis-speak: a rejected change comes back OK, so the canned line
  claimed success for work that did not happen.

  **Migrating.** If you call the tool by name from your own agent, rename it and
  rename `prompt` → `request` and `appId` → `app`; drop `instruction` into
  `request`. If you read fields off its result, read `id` and `title` off the
  receipt and say `say`. If you had a policy rule or an override matching
  `vendo_apps_create` / `vendo_apps_edit` / `vendo_apps_*` for the build tools,
  match `vendo_make` — it deliberately sits OUTSIDE the `vendo_apps_` prefix,
  because it is the front door rather than a member of the runtime's family. Core
  exports `isVendoAppsTool(name)` for anything that needs to recognise both.

  Everything else about the call is unchanged: risk grade `read` (actions inside
  the screen are still graded and consented individually at call time), the view
  channel, the build-failed banner, and the transcript's build card.

- a004031: **BREAKING:** the data hooks no longer return a generic `data` alias.

  `useApps`, `useThreads`, `useActivity`, `useApprovals`, `useConnections`,
  `useGrants`, `useAutomations` and `useApp` each returned the same value twice —
  under the named field the contract makes canonical (`apps`, `threads`,
  `events`, `pending`, `connections`, `grants`, `automations`, `app`) and again
  as `data`. The alias is removed; read the named field. `error`, `isLoading`,
  `refresh` and every write callback are unchanged.

  ```diff
  - const { data } = useApprovals();
  + const { pending } = useApprovals();
  ```

- a0dbfc6: The agent can now be told who the user is and what they are looking at.

  Two seams, both optional, both merged into one `[Situation]` block on every
  message the user sends:

  - **User facts.** The `user` resolver on the `authJs()` and `jwt()` auth presets
    may now return a `facts` object alongside the principal, and those facts reach
    the prompt. The session is decoded once per request for both the principal and
    the facts. An anonymous request resolves no facts.
  - **Live screen context.** `useVendoContext(data)` publishes structured host data
    for as long as the component is mounted, and retires it on unmount. Several
    mounted callers coexist and merge. `VendoProvider` also takes `captureScreen`
    (default `true`) to control the screen snapshot that rides the same channel.

  **BREAKING (`@vendoai/ui`, `@vendoai/vendo/react`): `useVendoContext` is now
  `useVendoProvider`.** The name `useVendoContext` previously belonged to the
  zero-argument hook that read everything `VendoProvider` supplies; it now belongs
  to the host-facing hook above, which takes data and returns nothing. Both names
  still exist, so the compiler is the thing that catches this:

  ```diff
  - const { client } = useVendoContext();
  + const { client } = useVendoProvider();
  ```

  Because both names still exist, the compiler catches this rather than the
  runtime: an existing zero-argument call now fails with `TS2554: Expected 1
arguments, but got 0`. Rename the call and you are done — nothing else about the
  provider value changed.

### Minor Changes

- 4b6e362: The agentic UI redesign: visible work, one card system, the ChatGPT-shaped center.

  Every consent, connect, grant-set, adoption and voice surface now renders
  through one card shell, so geometry lives in a single place and the cards
  differ only in contents. The transcript shows the agent's work as quiet human
  beats instead of lifecycle strings, and the center is a rail with New chat and
  two named doors over a pure home.

  Behaviour hosts may notice:

  - **`colors.border` is no longer read by the chrome.** The hairline is derived
    as ~8% of the foreground so the edge sits the same distance from text in any
    brand and in both colour schemes. A host that tuned `colors.border` to change
    Vendo's hairline will see no effect. `radius.small` and `radius.large` are
    now read (previously only `radius.medium` drove the sheet).
  - **A consent card's plain-words line comes from the RISK GRADE**, never from
    the tool's name. Host-authored `ToolMeta.description` still wins, and a
    sentence synthesized from the real inputs still outranks the class line. A
    tool nobody graded reads as ungraded, keeps its ceremony, and never folds its
    inputs behind a disclosure.
  - **Descriptor text never reaches an end user.** A tool descriptor's
    `description` is authored for the model; the card reads host `ToolMeta`
    instead, and falls back to copy Vendo wrote.
  - One shared approvals feed replaces three independent pollers (measured 39 →
    13 requests per 60s across three surfaces).
  - The mobile takeover inerts the host behind it rather than covering it, and no
    longer mints a second `<main>` landmark.

- 21c8b10: One brain, one scheduler, and consent that is per trigger — everywhere outside
  `@vendoai/automations` that has to agree with it.

  A fire-time call now carries WHICH trigger fired (`TriggerRef.id`) and WHICH
  firing it belongs to (`TriggerRef.lineageId`), so the guard matches an away grant
  on (app, trigger) instead of app-wide — arming one trigger no longer authorizes
  its siblings — and keys effect receipts on the firing, so re-running a run that
  failed loudly cannot repeat the work the first attempt already completed. The
  store carries that dimension too: grant and run rows index the trigger, so an
  adapter that trusts its own refs narrows exactly as far as the engine does
  instead of handing back a sibling trigger's grant. An agentic firing runs through
  the same away runner the rest of Vendo uses, seeing only the connector dispatcher
  it was actually granted. A machine app's `vendo.json` schedules are folded into
  its document triggers when the manifest syncs, so there is exactly one scheduler
  in the deployment (the automations engine) and one tick that drives it. The panel
  and the wire follow: per-trigger enable, disable, dry-run and adopt doors, a
  `POST /runs/:runId/rerun` door, and a run that stopped for a missing permission
  showing "Failed" with the consent card and Grant & re-run right on the row.

- ab5d181: Add `@vendoai/kit`, the runtime a generated app imports inside its box.

  A code-land app now has the same vocabulary a `.vendo` screen has, reaching the
  same implementations rather than parallel ones:

  - `reshape.{pick,rename,asPoints,format,sum,min,max,count}` — the eight LIVE
    reshape ops, each one call to core's `applyReshape`. The two deprecated ops
    (`asOptions`, `template`) are deliberately not wrapped, and `avg` retired with
    the pipe (#808) — code-land averages through the `average` aggregate below.
  - `sum`, `count`, `average`, `min`, `max`, `difference`, `daysUntil`, `groupBy` —
    the aggregates, evaluated by core's `evaluateExpr`. `sum(rows, "amount_cents")`
    runs the code path `sum(invoices.amount_cents)` runs; the seam is asserted
    against `evaluateExpr` directly, so a second implementation cannot appear
    without a test going red.
  - `useToolQuery` / `useToolAction` — the guarded read and write over the door
    that already exists, `POST /apps/:appId/call`, through the same
    `createVendoClient` the host's chrome uses. A non-ok outcome contributes no
    data and sets `dataUnavailable`, so a failed load never reads as "you have
    nothing"; a successful action refreshes the screen's queries.
  - `useVendoState` — the `$state` binding for code.
  - `<VendoAppProvider>` — the one provider, which derives the app id and wire base
    from the URL the wire serves the app at (`<base>/apps/:appId/serve/`), so a
    same-origin call rides the viewer's own session.

  `@vendoai/ui` gains two things this needed: the keyed `$state` store is now
  `useKeyedState` in `@vendoai/ui/kit`, shared by the tree renderer and code-land
  (one implementation, two venues, exactly as `fmt` is), and the wire client is
  reachable at `@vendoai/ui/client` so the shim calls the door through the existing
  client instead of a second fetch layer.

- 8d623ec: Connector discovery uses the broker's own search; execution stays ours.

  `search_connectors` searched a local keyword index and then EXPANDED a matching
  toolkit server-side, expecting the client to re-list via
  `notifications/tools/list_changed`. Measured live, Claude Code's agent SDK
  registers no list-changed handler for an HTTP MCP server — exactly one
  `tools/list` per session — so a tool the model had just found was uncallable for
  the rest of that session. The shape is one the industry has abandoned (GitHub
  removed `--dynamic-toolsets`; Composio, whose catalog this is, never shipped it).

  Three permanent tools replace it, so the listing never changes and callability
  never depends on a re-list. They are ordinary registry tools, so they work on
  both the `vendo()` and `claudeCode()` harness paths:

  - **`find_service_tools(need)`** — the connector's OWN search. Each match
    carries the callable slug, the full input schema, the caller's connection
    status and the broker's next-step message, inline, so the model can construct
    a call with no second lookup. A match the broker has no schema for says so
    rather than inviting a guess. The answer is bounded by its own SERIALIZED
    size, under the turn's `agent.toolOutputCap`, so it can never be the result
    that cap truncates: broker schemas are kilobytes each (Composio's run 5–7KB),
    and a result cut at a character count loses a schema mid-object with nothing
    saying which match lost it. Matches are included whole, in the broker's
    relevance order, until the budget is spent; whatever is left over is reported
    as `moreMatches` (a count) and `moreMatchesNote` (narrow the `need` and search
    again), never dropped silently. A single schema larger than the whole budget
    still returns its row, with the same `schemaUnavailable` marker that already
    sends the model to ask rather than guess.
  - **`use_service_tool(slug, arguments)`** — looks up the broker's per-tool risk
    tag, maps it to a `RiskLabel`, lets the guard decide run/ask/refuse, executes,
    and lands on the audit trail with its toolkit named — the same guarded path a
    `host_*` call travels. An untagged tool is `ungraded` (ask-by-default); risk is
    never inferred from a tool's name.
  - **`list_connections`** — unchanged, re-backed by the connector's connection API.

  The Composio adapter also trims the documentation Composio ships for PEOPLE
  inside the machine schema — `examples`, `human_parameter_name`,
  `human_parameter_description` — before a schema reaches the model. It is a third
  of the bytes and none of it is needed to construct a call (measured against
  their live catalog 2026-08-03: eight email matches, 36,407 chars whole, 24,736
  trimmed), so trimming is what lets a realistic search come back complete instead
  of short. Only KEYWORDS are removed: a parameter named `examples` is an
  argument, and survives.

  Both new tools exist only when a connector adapter can actually serve them
  ("no adapter, no tool"): `find_service_tools` and `use_service_tool` need a
  connector implementing the new capabilities, `list_connections` needs only a
  configured connector.

  **The Composio adapter's tool plane now speaks one API version, so a tool the
  search finds is a tool that runs.** Discovery is Composio's tool-router, which
  exists only at `v3.1`; execution and the `apps`-scoped listing were still on
  `v3`. Those are two different catalogs, not two doors onto one — so the model
  would find a slug and the executor would answer `Tool <SLUG> not found`, an
  opaque connector error rather than a connect card or a hint to search again.
  Live-measured against their catalog 2026-08-03, 19 of the 42 slugs a `v3.1`
  search returned for eight ordinary needs did not exist on `v3` at all: every
  Outlook mail and calendar action (`OUTLOOK_SEND_EMAIL`, `OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT`,
  `OUTLOOK_SEND_DRAFT`, `OUTLOOK_CALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT`), every `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_*`,
  five `TEXT_TO_PDF_*`, `GOOGLECALENDAR_EVENTS_GET` and
  `WEATHERMAP_GEOCODE_LOCATION`. It only stayed hidden because Gmail and Slack
  happen to exist in both. Connector tools that used to fail now run.

  The skew ran the other way too, so the listing moved with the executor: `v3`
  carries legacy names `v3.1` has renamed (`OUTLOOK_OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT`,
  `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_NEWS_SEARCH`), and a `v3` listing feeding a `v3.1` executor
  breaks identically. An `apps`-scoped host therefore sees the larger, current
  `v3.1` catalog — Gmail goes from 23 tools to 63, Outlook from 43 to 305 — and
  more of those tools arrive `ungraded`, which is ask-by-default.

  Connected accounts and auth configs stay on `v3` deliberately: live-verified
  identical on both versions, and that plane has no catalog to skew against.
  Both versions are named in one constant each at the top of the adapter.

  **Removed public surface.** All of it existed to serve lazy expansion:

  - `@vendoai/core`: `ToolListingContext.listingScope` and
    `ToolRegistry.releaseListingScope`. A listing no longer has to be identified —
    every tool a run may call is on every listing that run is given.
  - `@vendoai/actions`: `Connector.discoveryIndex`, `Connector.expandToolkits`,
    the `ToolkitIndexEntry` type, `ActionsRegistry.expandToolkits`, the `ctx`
    parameter of `ActionsRegistry.search`/`loadoutSeed`, and
    `ToolSearchOptions.maxExpansions`. `ActionsRegistry.loadoutSeed` now answers
    with every loaded tool and ignores its `connectedToolkits` argument: the
    argument only ever filtered lazily expanded connector tools, and there are
    none. New in their place, all optional:
    `Connector.searchTools`, `Connector.toolRisk`, `Connector.executeSlug`, and the
    `ServiceToolMatch` type. `Connector.toolkitOf` is unchanged — the pre-guard
    connect check still rides it.
  - `@vendoai/agent`: `CONNECTOR_DISCOVERY_TOOLS` now names the three tools above;
    the discovery registry's ports changed shape with them.
  - `@vendoai/mcp`: the door no longer advertises `tools.listChanged`, no longer
    diffs its listing around a call, and no longer keeps a per-session
    notification-replay flag.
  - `@vendoai/vendo`: the `maxSearchExpansions` handler option.

  **Known gap, deliberately not papered over.** A connector that cannot search
  gets neither new tool, and the zero-key Vendo Cloud connector has no search
  backend today — so a Cloud-default deployment that does not scope
  `connectorApps` reaches connectors through the connect dock only until the
  console broker exposes a search endpoint. Filling that with keyword scoring or
  name-based risk inference is exactly what this change removes.

  **Automations can run connector tools, through the consent they already use.**
  `use_service_tool` is one tool name standing in for the broker's whole catalog,
  so its descriptor cannot carry a real grade — it is `ungraded`, and design §12
  withholds `ungraded` from an unattended run the same way it withholds
  `destructive`. Left there, arming an automation on a connector would have been a
  narrowing: before this wave an individually-graded `read` connector tool WAS
  offered to an automation.

  The fix reuses declare-then-accrete consent rather than inventing a mechanism.
  An automation's steps declare the service actions they will call; the person
  arming it approves those specific actions, in the enable card they already see;
  the unattended run may then call exactly those slugs.

  - **`@vendoai/core`**: `GrantScope` gains a third member,
    `{ kind: "service-tool", slug }` — the missing middle between "this whole
    tool" (twenty thousand actions on this one name) and "this exact payload"
    (useless on the next run). Plus `USE_SERVICE_TOOL`, `serviceToolSlug`,
    `serviceToolPhrase`, `withResolvedRisk`, and `RiskResolver` (moved here from
    `@vendoai/guard`, which re-exports it unchanged).
  - **`@vendoai/guard`**: a `service-tool` grant matches a call by its slug.
    `tool` and `exact` grants are untouched, and nothing attended mints the new
    scope, so chat behaviour is unchanged.
  - **`@vendoai/automations`**: `AutomationsConfig.resolveRisk` — the SAME
    resolver the composition gives the guard. Arm-time capture grades a declared
    connector call with it, so the consent card states the grade the call will
    really run under and the grant it mints carries the descriptor hash the guard
    recomputes at fire time. Capture is per service action, and its consent
    sentence names the action in a person's words ("Allow "Morning digest" to
    fetch emails in Gmail while you're away").
  - **`@vendoai/ui`**: a consent row for a connector permission reads as its
    service action with the service's own logo, instead of "Use an outside
    service" once per row.

  What did NOT change: §12 still withholds the dispatcher from every unattended
  listing, and a granted service action the broker grades `destructive` is still
  refused away — the same answer a granted `host_*` send has always got.

  **Second known limit.** An agentic automation declares no slug, so it captures
  no connector grant at arm time: its connector calls park at fire time and
  accrete a per-slug grant when a person approves them. The alternative would have
  been a tool-wide grant on the dispatcher, which is the whole catalog behind one
  card.

- 6224a7e: An embedded app reports its height and the frame fits it — inside the host's
  bounds, never outside them.

  `HttpFrame` — the embedded served app — had no resize protocol at all. It sat at
  a fixed `min-height: var(--vendo-app-frame-height, 320px)`, so a served app was
  either padded with dead space or clipped, whichever way its real content fell.
  The jail frame next door has had a working protocol the whole time. There are now
  exactly ONE of them, shared:

  - `tree/frame-resize.ts` owns the identity gate (`event.source ===
iframe.contentWindow` — the one thing a sender cannot forge), the message
    validation, and the clamp. Both `JailedComponent` and `HttpFrame` call it, and
    the jail's private `MAX_JAIL_HEIGHT` and inline resize handler are gone. A
    security gate with two copies is a gate with two chances to be wrong.
  - The wire is unchanged, deliberately: the framed document posts
    `{ vendo: true, kind: "resize", height }` to its parent, exactly as the jail
    runtime already does. Nothing renamed, no field added.

  **The host's bounds win.** The host sized the slot when it embedded Vendo; that
  is a constraint the app lives inside, never overrides. The app _reports_ its
  natural height, and the frame fits that report between the host's floor and
  ceiling — an app taller than the ceiling scrolls inside its own frame instead of
  pushing the host's page around. Both bounds are plain CSS on the frame, so a host
  states them where it already styles Vendo and in whatever unit it likes:

  - floor: `--vendo-app-frame-height` (served apps, default 320px) and
    `--vendo-jail-min-height` (generated components, default 16px) — both already
    existed and both mean the same thing they did before.
  - ceiling: `--vendo-app-frame-max-height`, new, defaulting to `8192px` — the
    jail's old hard limit to the pixel, so a host that configures nothing gets
    exactly today's behaviour.

  No new React props: a host that never touches this sees no new API.

  **Breaking, small:** `AppFrameKeepalive.reopen` is removed. A woken machine used
  to mint a fresh ingress URL, so the frame had to notice the wake and re-open for
  the new address — and to notice it, it listened to four global activity events,
  tracked an activity flag, and read `document.activeElement` as a stand-in for
  activity it could not see inside a cross-origin frame. Served-app URLs are stable
  proxy URLs now: a wake is invisible to the frame, the address never changes, and
  there is nothing to recover. The `ping` leg is untouched and still keeps an
  on-screen embed's machine awake. Callers passing `{ ping, reopen }` drop
  `reopen`; nothing else changes.

- d0c3cc9: Risk grading stops guessing from tool names, and a tool nobody has graded now
  says so out loud instead of running.

  **The word lists are gone.** Extraction used to read a tool's name against
  `DESTRUCTIVE_WORDS` / `READ_WORDS` (and Composio slug verbs) to pick a grade.
  English is infinite, so that list was guaranteed to miss — _pay, charge,
  refund, approve, merge, publish_ were never on it — and its existence is what
  stopped anyone from auditing the labels. No code path concludes anything from
  a tool's name anymore.

  **Only facts grade a tool**, in priority order: a human (`overrides.json`), the
  AI judge (which reads the handler source and quotes its evidence), then
  protocol facts that are true by definition — HTTP `DELETE` is `destructive`, a
  declared GraphQL/tRPC `mutation` is at least `write`, and Composio's own
  `destructiveHint`/`readOnlyHint` say what they say. A `GET` is **not** a fact
  about reading (GETs that mutate exist) and a `POST` is not a fact about
  writing (search endpoints post).

  **⚠️ Breaking behavior: an unjudged catalog now asks on mutations.** Anything
  nothing above graded is the new first-class `ungraded` risk state, and the
  guard's default treatment is to ask — like `destructive`, and at the guard
  level rather than as an init-written rule, so a hand-wired server with no
  policy config at all gets it too. On an install that never ran the AI judge
  this is a real change: tools that used to run silently now park on an approval.
  That is the point — `payInvoice` classified `write` and ran un-gated. Three
  ways forward, and every one of them is a sentence:

  - run `vendo sync` with a model key so the judge grades the catalog;
  - grade the tools you care about by hand in `.vendo/overrides.json`;
  - or decide, in writing, that you accept them:
    `{ "match": { "risk": "ungraded" }, "action": "run" }`.

  `vendo doctor` reports the count plainly (`catalog: 34/61 tools ungraded`,
  code `E-TOOLS-003`), and a keyless `vendo init`/`vendo sync` says what the
  consequence is instead of implying the grades are real.

  **`critical` is now `confirmEach`.** Behavior is unchanged — checked before
  rules, grants, and the judge; none of them can suppress it; every call earns
  its own input-bound, single-use approval. The old name read as a severity rung
  and it is not one: the grade is a _fact_ about the action (a payment is a
  `write`), while `confirmEach` is _governance_ — who must be present. They are
  orthogonal, which is why a data export can be `read` + `confirmEach` and a bulk
  archive can be `destructive` without it. Host-authored files
  (`overrides.json`, `judgments.json`, `.vendo/tools.json`) accept `critical:` as
  a read alias indefinitely; every writer emits `confirmEach`. In TypeScript,
  `ToolDescriptor.critical` becomes `ToolDescriptor.confirmEach` and
  `decidedBy: "critical"` becomes `decidedBy: "confirmEach"`.

  **A standing denial means a person said no.** An ask that re-issues the same
  call id is answered by the user's earlier no instead of minting a new card — but
  only when a _human_ wrote it: an abandoned chat turn, a timed-out embed, and the
  TTL sweep reap the pending row and let the next issue ask again. A person's no
  also voids any unconsumed yes still sitting on the same call, and a decision can
  be taken back with `guard.approvals.revoke(id, principal)` / `DELETE
/approvals/:id` (the mirror of `grants.revoke`). Taking a decision back and
  replaying an approval are the same one-time transition, so a call can never both
  run and be voided — a take-back that arrives after the call was already
  authorized answers `conflict` rather than reporting success. `Guard` grows one
  optional method for the block that spends a yes WITHOUT replaying its call
  (automations arms a standing grant from it): `spendApproval(id, principal)`
  contends on that same transition and answers `spent` / `already-spent` /
  `taken-back`. Custom Guards are unaffected — callers feature-detect it, exactly
  like `abandonApprovals`.

  Three known limits, all written down at the code that carries them. The receipt
  is the only atomic step: an approval ROW has no guarded write (the store offers
  `atomic` for threads, apps and generic rows only), so every marker on it is a
  read followed by a write and something can move the row in between. Because the
  transition winner is settled before any row write, the worst that costs you is a
  stale marker — never an execution, since the transition a call would need is
  already spent. And a custom `Guard` that does not implement the optional
  `spendApproval` puts the automations grant mint back on that read-then-write
  footing, where a revoke landing in the window can lose to the mint; the guard
  that ships here has the seam. Third: when an automation's parked run resumes, its
  standing grant is written just before the call and taken back if the call is not
  authorized after all — every outcome the process lives through, a thrown one
  included, but a hard kill in between leaves that grant behind and nothing sweeps
  it. It shows up in `grants.list`, pinned to the tool's `descriptorHash`,
  app-bound and away-only, and you can revoke it.

  One consequence worth knowing: `descriptorHash` follows the field rename, so
  approvals and grants persisted before the upgrade no longer match their tool's
  new hash. They lapse into a re-ask, which is the fail-closed direction.

- 98eba22: A streaming turn never goes silent, and a turn whose client vanished can be
  rejoined.

  **SSE keepalive.** A turn's first byte waits on a provider call and a slow tool
  streams nothing for its whole duration, so the wire could sit quiet long enough
  for a proxy or a browser to drop the connection. Every turn response now leads
  with an SSE comment frame and gets one per 15s of silence. `@vendoai/core` gains
  `withSseKeepalive`, `startSseKeepalive`, `SSE_KEEPALIVE_FRAME` and
  `DEFAULT_SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_MS`; both engines' responses use it, and the
  `vendo try` dev server's own copy is gone.

  Hosts may notice: **the SSE body now contains comment frames.** They are ignored
  by the SSE grammar, so `useChat`, `DefaultChatTransport` and any spec-compliant
  parser see an unchanged message sequence — but a hand-rolled reader that assumes
  every frame starts with `data: ` needs to skip lines beginning with `:`. This is
  not a new event: there is no new `HarnessEvent` member and no new
  `data-vendo-*` part.

  **Stream resume.** The client half already shipped in `ai@6`
  (`ChatTransport.reconnectToStream`, which `useChat().resumeStream()` calls) and
  had no server to talk to, so a reload mid-turn painted the user's question and
  nothing else. The wire gains `GET /threads/:id/stream` — the SDK's own URL,
  method and 204 contract — serving the turn from the start of the stream and then
  following it live. Recording is per-turn, in memory, byte-capped, and dropped 30s
  after the turn settles; the persisted transcript remains the durable record.

  `useVendoThread` now resumes automatically after it loads a thread's transcript,
  and returns `resumeStream()` for surfaces that reconnect on their own.

### Patch Changes

- ab5d181: `@vendoai/ui/kit` now exports the embedded-surface runtime and the theme
  helpers a Vendo app needs inside its own box: `startFrameProtocol`,
  `applyThemeVars`, `postToHost`, and `themeCssVariables` / `resolveTheme` /
  `defaultVendoTheme`.

  The inner half of the frame resize protocol moves out of the jail runtime into
  `embedded-runtime.ts` so the jail and a box-served app share ONE implementation
  rather than two hand-maintained copies. Behaviour is unchanged, including the
  measured viewport-block normalization that keeps a `100vh` child from ratcheting
  an auto-sized frame to its cap.

- 4515c7f: The jail's `script-src` actually binds, so a sandboxed component cannot phone
  home.

  The generated-component jail carried `script-src 'nonce-<N>' 'unsafe-eval'`, and
  the nonce was the hole. CSP blanks a nonce's content attribute but not its IDL
  property, so code running inside the jail — which is the untrusted code — could
  read the jail's own nonce off a script element and stamp it on a `<script src>`
  of its own. Browser-verified against the shipped policy: the request completed,
  foreign code executed in the jail, and the data in its URL left the browser. A
  nonce in `script-src` also makes `'unsafe-inline'` be ignored, so the directive's
  source list — deliberately empty — never governed anything.

  The policy is now `script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`. Nothing about the
  jail is relaxed: `'unsafe-inline'` only permits inline script, which this
  document is entirely made of and which `'unsafe-eval'` already allowed the realm
  to produce, and with no nonce present the empty source list is finally the thing
  that decides. A component can no longer load a script from any origin, so the
  residual exfiltration risk — a shared or remixed component sending the data it
  was handed somewhere — is closed. `default-src 'none'`, `connect-src 'none'`,
  the opaque origin, and the `allow-scripts`-only sandbox are unchanged.

  Hosts are unaffected: an `about:srcdoc` frame also inherits the embedder's
  policy, and the jail boots (or does not) under exactly the same host policies as
  before.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ea3cb0b: A pin now has a payoff. Pinning a generated view used to be silent: the panel
  stayed open over the page, and the slot showed the app whenever its next ≤5s
  poll happened to fire — nothing connected the click to the result.

  Every pin affordance (the in-thread card bar and the workspace stage) now runs
  one sequence, graduated from the Keystone demo:

  1. the panel dismisses first, because the payoff is on the page and the card
     being pinned sits in a modal over a scrim;
  2. a ghost of the card flies into the slot (300ms) and the slot takes a settle
     pulse (180ms) — 480ms total, deterministic, and the slot is scrolled into
     view first so the landing is actually watchable;
  3. the slot re-reads on the pin event instead of waiting for the poll tick.

  `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the dismiss and the pulse and skips the flight.
  The ceremony is presentation only — the pin is still whatever the host's
  `onPin` writes — so a slot that is not mounted means no animation rather than a
  stranded ghost.

  New public surface, all optional:

  - `usePinAction()` (`@vendoai/ui/chrome`) — what the built-in affordances call.
  - `playPinCeremony({ appId, slot, dismiss })` — the same sequence for a host
    running a pin from its own control.
  - `announcePin(appId)` / `onPinAnnounced(listener)` (`@vendoai/ui`) — the bus
    `useSlotApp` listens on, for hosts that pin outside a Vendo surface.
  - `pinSlot` on `VendoRoot`/`VendoProvider` — the ceremony's destination. Only
    needed by hosts mounting several slots; with one, the ceremony finds it.

- 37ec12a: New `Remixable` chrome component: wrap any host element to mark it remixable.
  At rest a small muted ✦ sits in the element's top-right corner; hovering (or
  tabbing into) the element blooms it in place into a **✦ Remix** pill, held open
  for a 200ms grace so the cursor can travel to it. Clicking opens the
  conversation surface EMPTY with the element attached — a `Remixing · <name>`
  chip in the panel chrome that rides with the next message and clears on send —
  so the pill can never fire a turn on its own. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`
  the bloom snaps.

  ```tsx
  <Remixable name="Rent Roll">
    <RentRollTable units={units} />
  </Remixable>
  ```

  `name` is the surface in the host's own words (the chip's label, and what the
  agent is told); the optional `context` is one grounding line appended after the
  user's message, exactly like `VendoTrigger`'s. Hosts wiring their own element
  call `openVendoConversation({ remix: { name, context } })` — the same registry
  seam, now carrying an attachment alongside a prompt.

  Distinct from `VendoSlot`'s `remix` flag, which forks the component pinned in
  that slot; `Remixable` attaches any element to the next ask and forks nothing.

- 8f5a7c0: A failed turn now carries its own error, so the thread never shows a blank
  reply.

  When a turn's stream errored, the only trace on the wire was the ai-SDK `error`
  chunk. That chunk belongs to no message: it sets `useChat`'s transient `error`
  and nothing else. The turn itself persisted as an assistant message with **zero
  parts**, so the moment the thread was re-read — a reload, a thread switch,
  `VendoPage` refetching after the mint — the explanation was gone and the user's
  question sat there answered by a blank bubble. On a keyless install that
  blank bubble was the whole first experience: the server logged `Vendo found no
model key…`, the panel showed nothing durable.

  The agent now writes the same gated string (`wireErrorMessage` — Vendo's own
  crafted text or the fixed generic line, never provider internals) into the turn
  as a `data-vendo-turn-error` part beside the error chunk. It persists with the
  turn, and the thread renders it inline where the reply would have been, in the
  failed-beat vocabulary a failed app build already uses. The live banner keeps
  its Retry but drops its detail line while the turn is already saying it, so the
  same sentence is never printed twice.

  Additive to the wire (§15 forward-compat): consumers that don't recognize the
  part ignore it.

### Patch Changes

- dd73974: Three fixes the Keystone demo build turned up.

  **ConnectCard hangs on "Connecting…" under React StrictMode.** The card's
  cancel ref was only ever SET (by the effect's cleanup) and never reset on
  setup, so dev-mode's mount → cleanup → re-mount latched it before the user
  ever clicked: `completeConnection`'s poll loop saw "cancelled" on its first
  check, returned without throwing, and the card sat on the spinner forever.
  It now resets on setup, exactly like its sibling `ConnectedAccountsPanel`
  already did. Hosts no longer need `reactStrictMode: false` to demo a connect.

  **The composer centred its own text past one line.** `.fl-composer-row` was
  `align-items: flex-end`, which is right for a one-line field and wrong for
  every other: a textarea's text sits at ITS top, so as the field grew the row
  pushed the icons and Send DOWN while the text stayed put — the input read as
  mis-centred and Send moved under the cursor mid-sentence. The row is now
  top-anchored, so the field grows downward and the controls hold still. At one
  line the icon's 34px box and the text's 33px line box agree, so the collapsed
  composer is unchanged.

  **A single failed `apps.open` skeletoned a pinned app forever.** `useApp`
  recorded the error and every mounted surface kept rendering "Loading app…"
  until a full page reload. The load now retries three times with backoff
  (300ms, 600ms), and a load that really is dead renders a terminal state with
  a "Try again" button — in `VendoSlot` and in `VendoPage`'s app pane.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a7199db: Chrome polish wave + the automation card's missing emitter.

  - **Status ribbon docks onto the composer** (Codex-style): narrower than the
    composer, top corners only, its bottom edge tucked behind the card — no more
    floating pill with a gap, on both the page surface and the overlay's
    dock-anchor DOM.
  - **Approval card de-escalated**: the ceremony card keeps the neutral surface
    with a single amber accent bar instead of the full yellow wash; the
    ALL-CAPS "CRITICAL" eyebrow is gone; risk slugs render in the user's
    language ("Irreversible", "Makes changes", "Read-only") with the raw slug
    intact on `data-risk` and the tooltip.
  - **App-card dot stands down when ready**: the pulsing build dot fades and
    collapses once the view is generated; the ready bar carries just the name.
  - **`.fl-btn` is a non-wrapping flex row**: icon + label ride one line (the
    connect card's "Connecting…" spinner no longer folds onto its own line).
  - **`VendoPage` accepts `thread`** (`suggestions` + `discoverability`
    passthrough to the chat tab), so hosts can move their curated landing onto
    the full workspace; Maple's Ask Maple page and Cadence's assistant now
    render the workspace console.
  - **The automation card now actually streams**: `vendo_apps_edit` ok-outputs
    that armed an automation emit `data-vendo-automation` from the agent tool
    bridge (name-scoped, 01 §16), and the apps runtime reports the armed
    trigger's true `enabled` state on `EditResult.automation`. The playground
    gallery gains an "Automation created" scenario.

### Patch Changes

- 9532dc0: A turn that builds nothing no longer looks like it is building something.

  Between send and the first streamed chunk the thread painted a document-shaped
  skeleton card under a "Generating…" label. That window has no idea yet whether
  the turn will produce a view: on the live demos it showed on every turn, then
  resolved into plain prose or a refusal, which read as a generated view that had
  failed to arrive.

  The pre-first-chunk window now uses the same quiet liveness indicator every
  other waiting moment in a turn already uses, so the transcript promises nothing
  it may not deliver. Nothing changed about how a real build narrates: tool calls
  still speak through the status ribbon, and a forming generated view still shows
  "Building your view…" on the app card until it settles.

  `.fl-generating` and the `.fl-skeleton` card are removed from the chrome
  stylesheet (`.fl-skeleton-bar` stays — the markdown table's forming row uses
  it). The internal `MessageList` no longer takes `awaitingFirstChunk`.

- d6c231e: One visitor, one anonymous identity — consent-gated actions stop failing silently.

  An anonymous visitor's identity IS the opaque session pointer the door mints on a
  cookie-less wire request, and the door mints one PER REQUEST. A cold page load
  mounts several hooks at once (`/status`, `/approvals`, `/automations`,
  `/activity`, `/connections/catalog`, `/connections`), so every one of them left
  cookie-less and minted its own subject; the browser's jar kept whichever
  `Set-Cookie` landed last and the rest were orphaned. Measured live: one page load
  produced four distinct subjects, three orphaned.

  The damage lands on the trust mechanism at the centre of the product. An agent
  run created its consent approval under one subject, the user's Approve arrived as
  another, and guard correctly refused another subject's approval — surfacing as
  `Approval apr_… was not found` and a run stuck on "waiting for your approval"
  forever. Every consent-gated action failed this way, and the same split emptied
  the activity feed mid-run.

  The browser is the visitor boundary, so `createVendoClient` is the layer that can
  close the race honestly: the first request through a client may leave
  cookie-less, and every request issued before it answers now waits for it and
  travels with the pointer it established. Costs one extra round trip on a cold
  load and nothing afterwards; a failed first request releases the gate rather than
  holding it, so the old behaviour is the floor, never something worse.

  Deliberately NOT solved by fingerprinting the requester (IP/User-Agent would
  merge two real visitors behind one NAT into a single session, sharing threads,
  grants and approvals) nor by deriving the pointer from request attributes (that
  would make a live session guessable, where today it is a 2^128 search). Hosts
  that already mint the pointer on their document response keep working unchanged —
  the door treats a pre-established pointer as canonical.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c7277f6: Knowledge verifier pass: where the evidence score provably cannot decide, a cheap model does.

  Calibration against the cloud engine found that answerable and unanswerable questions score in the same range, so at the best possible bar 47% of unanswerable questions still got a confident answer. `@vendoai/knowledge` now exports `entailmentVerifier`: a capped, schema-constrained check that reads the passages a search returned and decides whether they can answer the question at all. An unsupported verdict becomes the existing `insufficient-evidence` outcome, carrying the gap the verifier named so the agent can say WHAT the docs do not cover.

  **It is not score-gated.** It reads every search that returns hits. An earlier design ran it only inside a calibrated score band; the live run showed four unanswerable questions per pass scoring outside that band, never being checked, and being answered — so a check gated on the number it exists to replace inherits that number's blind spots.

  **What it is measured to do.** Live against the cloud engine over the 94-question corpus: false answers 7/34 and 10/34 on its two passes, false refusals 3/60, reading 94/94 searches at 1.37-1.39 model calls per search and adding p50 ~2.5s of verification to a verified turn (summed over that turn's calls; one call's median is ~1.7-1.8s). It reduces confident wrong answers sharply — the same corpus loses 19/34 with the check gated to a score band — but it does not eliminate them, because it cannot refuse when a verification times out and it is sometimes simply wrong. The per-question records and the full table, including the removed gated configuration, are in `docs/eval/KNOWLEDGE.md`.

  **OFF by default.** `VENDO_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFY=on` opts in for the Cloud engine; a value that is neither on nor off throws at composition rather than silently disabling a trust feature. It ships off because the measurement says it does not clear the zero-false-answer bar it exists for, while costing a model call per search and seconds on a call the user waits through — that trade is the host's to make, not a default. Only the Cloud engine composes it; BYO and self-hosted engines are untouched.

  **Enabling the check changes no threshold.** The host's `weakScoreThreshold` (default 0) is exactly what it was, and it still decides every search the check could not read. When there is a verdict the verdict decides, in both directions.

  **It fails open, and says so.** No model, a timeout, or an unusable response yields no verdict: the tool answers the way it would have without a verifier and marks the result with the additive `unverified` field on `vendo/knowledge-result@1`. The thread renders that as the amber "I couldn't check this answer against the documentation" line beside the sources, so a check that did not run is never mistaken for one that passed. Verification is capped per TURN as well as per call, so a chat→deep escalation cannot spend the cap twice.

  An empty or placeholder gap ("", "n/a", "none") fails the verdict schema, so a verdict with its evidence torn off yields no verdict at all and the tool falls open marked, rather than refusing a user with a reason that says nothing.

  The verifier rides its own `knowledgeVerifier` model slot (`VENDO_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE_VERIFIER`, `models.knowledgeVerifier`) beside `judge` — pinning the model that grades answers no longer repoints the one that gates them.

  `@vendoai/knowledge` now declares `ai` as a peer dependency (with the zod floor every ai peer needs), matching `@vendoai/guard`.

- f5fbb4b: Make the MCP door presentable: per-surface tool menus, human tool titles, and
  risk-derived MCP annotations.

  Hosts curate what each surface offers from `.vendo/overrides.json`'s new
  `surfaces` block (`agent` and `mcp`, a closed key set so a misspelled surface
  fails loudly at parse). `ActionsRegistry.surfaceMenu()` resolves it: the
  authored list wins, an absent `agent` menu is unrestricted, and an absent `mcp`
  menu falls back to every merged, enabled tool whose `audience` is `end-user` or
  unset. Menus are curation, not security: the guard, `disabled`, and audience
  exclusions are untouched, an off-menu call returns the same not-found an unknown
  tool returns, and a menu entry naming a missing or disabled tool warns once and
  is skipped rather than taking the host down. Vendo's own `vendo_*` runtime tools
  are never curated away on either surface.

  `ToolDescriptor` and `ToolOverride` gain an optional `title`: the short human
  label for surfaces people read. `vendo sync`'s AI enrichment proposes one per
  tool (presentation, so it is exempt from the restrictive-only clamp and carried
  across structural syncs); `.vendo/overrides.json` corrects it. The door emits it
  in both standard MCP places (top-level `title` and `annotations.title`), and
  approval cards prefer it over the prettified tool id, behind an in-code
  `ToolMeta.label`.

  **Upgrade note.** Every tool the door lists now carries `annotations`
  unconditionally, including for hosts with no `surfaces` block. That means a
  `read` tool asserts `readOnlyHint: true` to clients, and some MCP clients use
  that hint to skip their own confirmation prompt for read calls. Nothing changes
  server-side: Vendo's guard, policy, approvals, and audit decide exactly what
  they decided before, and annotations are hints the spec says clients may
  ignore. If you have a `read`-labelled tool that is not actually side-effect
  free, correct its `risk` in `.vendo/overrides.json` — that label was already
  driving your policy.

  Every tool the door lists now also carries `annotations` derived from its risk
  label (`read` → `readOnlyHint`, `destructive` → `destructiveHint`), and the door
  serves a themed, script-free, unauthenticated connect page at `{mount}/connect`
  with the MCP URL and per-client setup steps for Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor.
  demo-bank ships a curated twelve-tool menu as the worked example.

### Patch Changes

- fd9260d: Empty-states batch — a fresh install's FIRST generated app now renders well
  with no bindable host data. Generation always emits the requested component
  bound to its tool (the Kit renders the designed empty state) instead of
  omitting it or writing prose into a tile; the no-data explanation is one
  consolidated "About this view" note, charts route to the Kit, and the app
  name is a <=40-char display title (validated on create) instead of the
  request echoed back. The Kit stat tile shows a compact em dash for empty
  values and truncates prose-length text into a tooltip, empty label/value
  pairs render an em dash, and the in-thread app panel scrolls its top into
  view when a live build settles. The create-app tool description also stops
  callers baking pre-computed figures or branding into the prompt.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.7

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 60c5e39: A create_app build can no longer die silently (0.4.5 E2E cert defect D, byo-ai-sdk host). Three layers: a build whose every region was disclaimed away ("This part of the request isn't available on this host.") now fails terminally with an honest host-capability reason instead of persisting as a "successful" app that reads as a build hanging forever; a server-side build watchdog persists a terminal failed record when a build task neither completes nor throws inside its window (VENDO_APP_BUILD_WATCHDOG_MS, default 4 min), so the embed always resolves even if the build promise hangs or is severed by the host runtime; and the embed's build deadline is now an absolute client-side timer with a per-poll timeout, so a hung open() poll can no longer freeze the building beat past the deadline.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.6

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 31f899e: A chat turn whose app build terminally fails now ENDS, with the classified
  failure reason visible in the thread. Before, the failed build came back as a
  plain error outcome only the model could see: the tray rendered nothing, and
  the model re-ran the minutes-long doomed build inside the same turn until the
  step cap — a thread stuck "streaming" for 10+ minutes with no banner and no
  reason (0.4.4 E2E cert). The agent's tool bridge now streams an additive
  `data-vendo-build-failed` part (toolCallId + the runtime's canned, non-leaky
  reason) beside the failed `vendo_apps_create` result, the agent loop stops the
  turn after the failed build (re-asking is the user's call, matching the BYO
  embed's failed vocabulary), and the thread renders the part as an error beat
  with the reason.

  The generation engine also names an empty model stream as its own failure
  class ("completed without any text output") instead of reporting the empty
  string's wire-parse issues — the 0.4.4 cert's "wire missing-app / empty
  layout" failures were a gateway alias ending turns reasoning-only, not a
  model-format defect, and the old issue list mis-routed that triage.

### Patch Changes

- 89e3d2b: Mid-stream turn errors are no longer a dead end: the agent logs the real
  error server-side ("[vendo] turn stream error") and passes its OWN safe
  errors (VendoError code + message) to the wire recognizably prefixed, while
  raw provider/transport strings stay the fixed generic text. The thread
  error banner renders that safe detail line (code included) next to Retry —
  "Something went wrong" alone is now reserved for errors we genuinely can't
  say more about.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- a48b1b7: Wave 2 runtime fixes from the 0.4.x E2E certification campaign:

  - Mastra shim: open-schema guarded tools (extracted routes whose body shape
    is untyped) no longer execute with `{}` when the user dictated args.
    Mastra's provider schema-compat layers hard-close every object schema for
    strict-mode providers, so an open input reached the model as "takes no
    arguments"; the shim now bridges open inputs through one declared `args`
    property (JSON object or JSON-encoded string) and unwraps it before the
    guard, so approvals park — and replay — with the real arguments.
  - Failed app builds now carry their reason everywhere: `create()` re-throws
    with the classified reason in the message (the tool outcome the calling
    agent reads), logs the un-canned issue list to the operator terminal
    (previously a silent failure), and the app embed shows a retry hint for
    retryable failures. The generation engine now captures streamText's
    swallowed provider errors, so quota/timeout/no-key failures classify
    correctly instead of collapsing to "generation failed".
  - The dev model's no-usable-credential lines (missing provider package, no
    key at all) surface verbatim in the failed-build reason — the in-surface
    error now carries the actionable `npm install @ai-sdk/...` / `vendo login`
    instruction instead of `model could not produce a valid app`.
  - `@vendoai/ui` DonutChart no longer crashes on `undefined`/non-array data
    inside generated apps; it renders the designed empty state like the other
    Kit charts.

### Minor Changes

- 4b8ac66: Per-user connected accounts via the Composio broker (ENG-262). Connectors gain a subject-scoped `connections` capability (list/initiate/status/disconnect); the umbrella serves per-principal `/connections` endpoints with a Vendo Cloud broker seam behind `VENDO_API_KEY`; a Composio call missing a connection returns the new typed `connect-required` tool outcome, rendered by `VendoThread` as an inline connect card that retries after connecting; `ConnectedAccountsPanel` (list + disconnect) joins the chrome as the accounts tab. Composio tools carry curated risk (metadata hints + slug patterns) instead of a blanket `write`; the MCP connector accepts an async per-principal `headers` resolver with per-subject sessions; every connector execution is audited with its account identity.
- a7d57b7: Composer upgrades (ENG-215): the message textarea now autogrows with its content
  (caps at max-height, then scrolls); typing is never blocked while a turn streams;
  a message sent mid-turn visibly queues and auto-sends the moment the turn
  completes (Stop stays the explicit interrupt). Adds Edit on the last user turn
  (refills the composer and drops the turn so re-sending amends rather than
  duplicates) and Regenerate on the last assistant turn. Fixes the focus dump to
  `<body>` that used to break Escape and the overlay focus trap when the composer
  disabled mid-turn. `useVendoThread` now exposes `setMessages` for headless parity.
- e9c538c: Tool & approval humanization (ENG-216): add an additive, UI-side host-metadata
  seam (`VendoProvider` `tools` prop — friendly labels, descriptions, and custom
  arg summarizers per tool) with a formatting fallback that prettifies raw tool
  ids and formats args into readable summaries. Tool chips no longer show the raw
  slug or the ai-SDK lifecycle string, consecutive identical tool chips collapse
  into one entry with a count, and the in-thread `ApprovalCard` no longer
  fabricates or displays a context byline (the queue path keeps its real
  server-provided `ctx`). No contract or wire changes.
- da4d3e8: Extreme-content solidity (ENG-218): the thread stays smooth no matter how long
  the transcript or how large a single message. Long threads are windowed — only a
  bounded trailing slice of turns is in the DOM, with a "Show N earlier messages"
  control that reveals the deferred head in chunks and anchors the viewport so the
  reader is never yanked. Entrance animations are gated on restore, so reopening a
  200-turn thread no longer fires every `fl-item-in` rise at once. Markdown is
  memoized so a streaming turn only re-parses the block that changed instead of
  re-parsing every settled turn per token, and a restored huge message (pasted
  logs, model dumps) collapses behind a "Show full message" expander that bounds
  both parse time and node count. Raw tool-payload previews in the approval card
  are likewise capped. Stick-to-bottom and jump-to-latest are preserved under all
  of the above.
- a2ca8e2: Palette + Page fixes (ENG-222). `VendoPalette`'s keybinding is now a
  host-collision-safe singleton: one shared listener no matter how many palettes
  mount (no more double-toggle across mounts), a configurable `hotkey` prop
  (a chord like `{ key: "k", meta: true }`, a custom matcher function, or `false`
  to disable the keyboard opener entirely), and it no longer steals a keystroke
  from a focused host input while closed. `VendoThread` gains an optional
  `onThreadId` callback that fires with the effective (possibly server-minted)
  thread id. `VendoPage`'s chat sidebar now refreshes when a conversation started
  via "New conversation" mints its thread, so the new conversation appears (and
  highlights) instead of never showing; an explicit selection also survives a
  background list refresh.
- b819ab2: Slot: wire the empty-state CTA + pinned-component placement path (ENG-223).
  `VendoSlot`'s empty state is now a real, focusable `<button>` (was a
  non-interactive div): activating it opens the authoring surface via the new
  optional `onAuthor(slotId)` prop, and — when no handler is supplied — opens a
  mounted `VendoPalette` through the new `openVendoPalette()` singleton opener
  (host-collision-safe like the keybinding; a no-op when no palette is mounted).
  `VendoSlot` also gains a `pin` prop for the "or a pinned component" path in
  08-ui §4: a pinned `vendo-genui/v1` view (`{ payload, data?, onAction? }`)
  now mounts in place through the tree renderer and the PinMount error boundary,
  falling back to the host's original children if it throws — previously a slot
  could only mount a whole app, so hosts pinning a generated component had to
  bypass `VendoSlot` with a bare `AppFrame` (no fallback). The Cadence demo hero
  slot is switched to this path.
- 75cb256: Activity panel rebuild (ENG-224): the self-scoped activity surface now renders
  real semantics instead of a raw data dump. Each row is a concrete action taken
  as the user — a kind badge (Tool, Approval, Connection, …) plus a humanized
  action label (host tool metadata wins, else the prettified slug, never a raw
  id), a plain-language result (Succeeded / Failed / Awaiting approval / Blocked /
  Connect required / Running) with a status glyph, and a human, timezone-stable
  timestamp ("Jul 11, 2026, 12:00 PM") in place of the raw ISO instant. Pagination
  now ends in an explicit end-of-list marker: `useActivity` exposes `hasMore`, which
  flips to `false` once a page adds no new events, so "Load more" retires instead of
  re-fetching nothing. No contract or wire changes.
- 5093682: Implement the full dead-CSS affordance set (ENG-225): copy actions on every
  settled turn, code-block copy, drag-drop attach with image preview chips and
  sent-attachment rendering in the transcript, the waiting-on-you approval queue
  (mounted in VendoPage chat, exported as `WaitingQueue`), the `VendoToasts`
  delivery surface with an imperative `vendoToast()` API and opt-in
  approval-required toasts, and the connect dock + liquid tray in the composer
  (new optional `connectors` catalog on `VendoProvider`; `ConnectCard`'s
  initiate → OAuth → poll flow is now the shared `completeConnection`).
- 083a3b9: Voice v1, the full designed stage (ENG-229): resilient realtime driver
  (connect timeout, bounded reconnect with fresh re-dial, mute via track.enabled,
  live amplitude, humanized failure messages) and the rebuilt `VendoStage` —
  amplitude-driven blob, two-row sticky captions, transcript drawer, consent bar
  (approvals decidable mid-call, with receipts), renderer-backed session-view
  feed with slide focus + dots, reconnecting/error banners with Retry, and exit
  settle choreography (`onSessionEnd`). `useVoice()` additionally returns
  `error`, `muted`, `setMuted`, `amplitude`, and `views`.
- 0f17f39: Voice live pipeline — the realtime tool-call bridge (ENG-319). The realtime
  driver gains an optional `act: VoiceToolBridge`: its `tools` ride the provider
  `session.update` and every model function call funnels through `onToolCall`,
  whose resolved value returns to the model as the function output. The shipped
  `createVoiceActBridge({ client })` exposes one `vendo_act` tool that runs a REAL
  guarded agent turn per call over `POST /threads` — minted views stream into the
  stage feed via `VoiceActSession.emitView`, parked guard approvals reach the
  stage consent bar (ENG-229), and the turn resumes through the existing
  assistant-upsert approval-response path with the guard authoritative over
  execution. No new server surface, no wire change; Maple's voice driver is wired
  to it. Additive 08-ui amendment parked for Yousef sign-off.
- ff6b5d5: Principals + orgs (ENG-263). Anonymous→signed-in auto-merge: the first authenticated request carrying a valid anon cookie adopts the session's threads/apps/state into the real subject and retires the cookie — idempotently, without ever overwriting an existing row; grants, approvals, and connected accounts deliberately do not migrate (consent doesn't transfer identities). Away re-verification rides actAs: the host declining to mint fails the run closed, and every actAs-authenticated call audits its disposition (`detail.actAs`). Runtime-minted subjects move into the reserved `vendo:` namespace (`vendo:webhook:<source>`); host principal resolvers producing reserved subjects (or org-kind principals) are rejected loudly. `kind:"org"` and the `vendo:org:<id>` subject shape remain reserved but inert — no org storage, management surface, or activation ships in this release.
- 0c10661: Add the Kit (`@vendoai/ui/kit`): 31 smart, host-brand-native, generative-UI components — a strict superset of Crayon/Tambo/json-render/Tremor surfaces. Layout, a semantic value tier (Money takes integer cents, dates/percent/num Intl-formatted, `$NaN`/`Invalid Date` unrenderable), a TanStack-Table DataTable (sort/filter/search/paginate/dot-path columns/per-column format/named-query empty state), recharts charts (Line/Bar/Donut/Sparkline/Progress with designed empty/invalid states), forms (Select over raw object arrays, action-gated Button, first-class Disclaimer), and self-managing Tabs/Callout/Accordion. Every prop is zod-schema'd and classed `config | copy | data`; `kitPrompt()` renders the model-facing prompt from those schemas. The existing prewired set is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 51f3fc9: Fix (ENG-353): heartbeat-armed idle-abort fallback for client disconnects the runtime never surfaces. Under `next dev` a real browser's graceful tab-close/navigate-away fires neither `request.signal` nor a stream cancel, so an abandoned turn ran to completion and burned provider tokens. The panel now beats `POST /threads/:id/heartbeat` while a turn streams; the first beat arms a server-side idle watchdog that aborts the turn through the same controller as the fast path after ~15s of silence. The fetch-abort fast path is unchanged, and consumers that never beat (curl/scripted clients) keep exact run-to-completion semantics.
