Server-actions extractor behind the extractor seam (ENG-248): statically scan `"use server"` modules and inline functions with the TypeScript compiler API, interpret zod-validated and annotated inputs into JSON Schema (fail-closed to permissive + note otherwise), and emit the additive `server-action` binding kind (`module` + `exportName` + ordered `params`) within `vendo/tools@1`. Execution is direct in-process registration: `vendo init` now generates a `vendo-actions.ts` registration map wired into `createVendo({ serverActions })`; a server-action tool whose registration is missing fails closed with a clear error and no work performed. Risk labels fail closed — actions default `write`, the destructive word list applies, and unclassifiable or inline (non-importable) actions are emitted `disabled: true` with a note.
